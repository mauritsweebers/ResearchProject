🟢 PHASE X DIRECTIVE – [Insert Phase Title Here]

You are generating a complete PhaseX synthesis in a single session.

---

🎯 OBJECTIVE
[Insert 1-paragraph description of the goal of this phase, e.g., Nutritional Viability, Agricultural Feasibility, etc.]

---

📤 REQUIRED DELIVERABLES
For each module in this phase, generate the following:
- TX: `.txt` summaries, methods, or decision narratives
- DT: `.csv` structured datasets (e.g. supply matrices, demographic tables)
- FG: `.svg` or `.png` figures (e.g. flow diagrams, risk maps)

---

📁 FILE AND FOLDER STRUCTURE RULES
You must organize files into this structure:
phaseX/
├── module1/
│   ├── data/       → for `.csv` DT files
│   └── outputs/    → for `.txt` TX and `.svg` FG files
├── module2/
│   └── ...
├── PhaseX_Summary.txt        → executive summary
├── PhaseX_Metadata.csv       → metadata table for all deliverables

---

📑 METADATA FILE REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)
You must generate and include a metadata file named:

PhaseX_Metadata.csv

It must include a row for each file you create, with these columns:
- Index Code
- Phase
- Module
- Type (TX, DT, FG)
- Title/Description
- File Name
- Source Category (🟢 A, 🟡 B, 🔴 C)
- Notes

Example:
Index Code,Phase,Module,Type,Title/Description,File Name,Source Category,Notes
P2.M3.DT01,2,3,DT,Crop allocation by nutrient density,P2_M3_DT01_CropAllocation.csv,🟢 A,Uses FAO land productivity data

---

📦 FINAL PACKAGING
Place all content inside a single phaseX/ folder and export it as a `.zip`.

The `.zip` must include:
- All deliverables in the correct structure
- PhaseX_Metadata.csv
- PhaseX_Summary.txt
