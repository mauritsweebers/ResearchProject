PHASE 9 REMEDIATION PROPOSAL – Action Map for Feasibility Enhancement

Top Remediation Priorities:
- Expand transition financing in LMICs via green bonds and fiscal realignment
- Formalize labor protection and retraining in agro-economic transitions
- Activate narrative reframing and culturally adaptive messaging
- Diversify food trade to reduce substitution risk in import-dependent regions

Deployment:
Each strategy maps to an identified failure node in Modules 1–3 and is ready for inclusion in Phase 10 policy blueprints and implementation pilots.
