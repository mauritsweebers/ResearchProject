Phase 9 Remediation: Phase 7 - Module 1 (Stakeholder Resistance Mapping)

This output structures stakeholder critiques into a resistance matrix using:
- P7_M4_DT01_CritiqueTable.csv

Classification Logic:
- Resistance Form: Mapped as Economic, Ideological, or Legal based on critique language
- Actor Type: Inferred from disciplinary lens (e.g., Indigenous = networks, rural sociology = labor groups)
- Region Scope: Defaulted to Global South based on critique nature; refine with further localization if needed

Deliverable: P9_M1_StakeholderResistanceMatrix.csv

Purpose:
Supports adversarial and dissent-aware scenario planning in Phase 8. Identifies sources and forms of likely opposition.

Compliant with Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6 and SCF v1.0 (ðŸŸ¢ Phase 7 source).
