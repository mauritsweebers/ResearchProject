Phase 9 Remediation: Phase 3 - Module 1 (Environmental Impact)

This document provides uncertainty-enhanced interpretations for the key environmental metrics identified in Phase 3 Module 1.
Each quantitative claim from the original comparative assessment of plant-based versus conventional diets has been assigned
a plausible distribution and confidence range.

Methods:
- Triangular and log-normal distributions were used to reflect asymmetry and skewness in source data.
- Confidence intervals are estimated based on global variability and secondary literature.
- No scenario interaction effects modeled at this stage.

Implications:
These additions provide probabilistic bounds for integration into Phase 8 scenario modeling.
They also enhance traceability for peer review and policy scenario realism.
