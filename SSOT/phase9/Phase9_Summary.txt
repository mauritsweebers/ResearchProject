PHASE 9 – System Integration, Vulnerability Mapping, and Remediation Synthesis (Final)

Date Finalized: 2025-05-28
Modules: 5 | Deliverables: 10

Objective:
To integrate Phases 0–8 into a unified system-wide analysis, identify exposure nodes, and model cross-domain vulnerability patterns. Phase 9 confirms feasibility boundaries and builds failure-mode aware solutions.

Summary:
- Module 1 surfaces geographic and demographic risk intersections, particularly for informal labor, gendered food access, and rural dependency
- Module 2 builds the uncertainty register and identifies major propagation pathways
- Module 3 models interlocked system risk scenarios where failure in one domain cascades into others
- Module 4 constructs remediation maps for high-risk failure nodes
- Module 5 finalizes a regionally disaggregated verdict with feasibility grades and system notes

Conclusion:
The integrated system is viable with a global average grade of B. But feasibility is not uniform, and reform must address specific systemic fragilities. Outputs now prepare Phase 10 for structured implementation guidance.
