------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE
This document provides a cross-phase critique of the structured evidence produced in Phases 1 through 8 of the project examining the feasibility of a global shift to plant-based diets. The review focuses on structural completeness, analytic robustness, and domain-level blind spots.

------------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM-WIDE CONCERNS

1. Lack of Cross-Phase Linkages:
   - Metadata and summaries infrequently reference outputs from other phases by Index Code.
   - Limits auditability of final synthesis (Phase 8).

2. Missing Population-Level Differentiation:
   - No explicit treatment of vulnerable populations (e.g., women, children, indigenous groups, rural poor).
   - Appears in Phases 1 (nutrition), 4 (labor economics), 5 (cultural norms).

3. No Probabilistic Modeling:
   - Outputs rely on deterministic or static point estimates.
   - Variance, uncertainty ranges, and distributional sensitivity are not reported.

4. Behavioral Evidence Gaps:
   - Little data on dietary behavior change under economic, social, or cultural stressors.
   - Especially needed in Phases 1, 5, and 6.

5. Undercoverage of Low-Income Contexts:
   - Many outputs focus on OECD or generalized global patterns.
   - Lack of geographic granularity weakens conclusions for Africa, South Asia, Latin America.

PHASE-BY-PHASE OBSERVATIONS

Phase 1 – Nutritional Viability:
- No treatment of micronutrient bioavailability or supplementation reliance.
- Lacks disaggregation by gender, age, or health status.

Phase 2 – Agricultural Feasibility:
- Static yield data without agroecological stratification.
- Omits modeling of alternative systems (e.g., agroforestry, intercropping).

Phase 3 – Environmental Impact:
- Robust GHG, land, and biodiversity data.
- Missing aquatic ecosystem metrics and climate-agriculture feedback modeling.

Phase 4 – Economic Viability:
- Strong on macro-trade and production costs.
- Lacks consumer affordability analysis and coverage of informal markets.

Phase 5 – Cultural and Political Realities:
- Maps actor influence and discursive framing.
- Omits deeper ideological resistance structures and governance capacity diagnostics.

Phase 6 – Transition Mechanisms:
- Comprehensive mapping of tools.
- No analysis of historical transition failures or fiscal feasibility gaps.

Phase 7 – Robustness Testing:
- Basic sensitivity analysis included.
- Lacks adversarial or stakeholder critique simulations.

Phase 8 – Synthesis and Scenario Modeling:
- Scenarios are integrative but static.
- Missing temporal resolution and tipping point modeling.

------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Add uncertainty ranges and scenario variants (Phases 3, 4, 8)
2. Disaggregate data by vulnerable populations (Phases 1, 4, 5)
3. Back-reference cross-phase outputs using metadata Index Codes
4. Include structured opposition/actor maps (Phases 5, 7)
5. Expand LMIC and informal sector evidence base (Phases 2, 4, 6)

This QA report should accompany the final Phase 8 package and inform any synthesis publication or transition modeling.
