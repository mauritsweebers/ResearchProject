Command Protocol – Module Completion, Audit, and Transition
Version: 1.1
Issued by: Project Director

------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW

This protocol governs how Command validates the completion of each research module across all phases. It ensures structural integrity, evidentiary standards, and operational discipline are upheld prior to transition.

------------------------------------------------------------
TRIGGER

The protocol is activated when:
1. A full set of submission metadata for a module is received, OR
2. The phase team indicates the module is complete.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: PROVISIONAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Command responds:
- "Module provisionally complete. Please provide the module folder (or .zip) for audit."

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: MODULE FOLDER AUDIT

Upon receipt of the folder, Command will:
✅ Inspect the directory structure:
   - Must include /data/, /outputs/, /logs/, /references/
✅ Confirm presence of all registered files:
   - Match against Master Index Register
✅ Verify file naming conventions:
   - Must follow SSOT format (P0_M1_DT01_...)
✅ Confirm storage compliance:
   - Files must be in correct subfolders

⚠️ Additional Checks:
- Flag .DS_Store or metadata pollution
- Validate filenames against index codes

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: CONTENT AUDIT — RELEVANCE & COMPLETENESS

Command conducts qualitative review of content coverage:
✅ Each required output type (DT, TX, FG) is present
✅ All outputs align with the directive’s scope and dimensions
✅ Evidence bases are complete and relevant to stated objective
✅ Key metrics, breakdowns, or disaggregations are not missing
⚠️ Missing visuals, gaps in regional detail, or partial data tables are flagged
❌ Outputs using unverifiable or off-topic data are rejected

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4: MODULE STATUS DECLARATION

Command formally assigns one of the following status labels:
✅ COMPLETE – All required elements are present, correct, and relevant
⚠️ CONDITIONALLY COMPLETE – Accepted with minor omissions or optional recommendations
❌ INCOMPLETE – Mandatory elements missing or noncompliant

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 5: TRANSITION TO NEXT MODULE

Once status is declared:
- Command issues the next directive
- A new task order is posted to the phase chat
- Outstanding fixes (if any) are documented and tracked

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE

Command authority cannot be overridden. Directives proceed only after a successful audit.
