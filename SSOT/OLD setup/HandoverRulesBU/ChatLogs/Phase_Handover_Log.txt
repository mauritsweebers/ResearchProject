LEARNED DELIVERY RULES AND STRUCTURE â€” PHASE-BASED SYSTEM LOG

PROJECT ARCHITECTURE
---------------------
- Objective: Assess whether the global population can be fed a nutritionally complete and healthy plant-based diet under ecological, economic, and cultural constraints.
- Structure: The project proceeds in clearly demarcated phases (0â€“8), each focused on a critical dimension (e.g., Nutrition, Environment, Economics, etc.).
- Output Style: Structured, academically rigorous, interdisciplinary, and based on peer-reviewed or institutional evidence.
- Final Integration: No overarching conclusions are drawn until Phase 8: Synthesis and Scenario Modeling.

PHASE DELIVERABLE RULES
------------------------
Each phase must be delivered with the following conventions:

Folder Structure:
phaseX/
â”œâ”€â”€ module1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/        # CSV or structured data tables (DT)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ outputs/     # Text summaries (TX), figures (FG)
â”œâ”€â”€ module2/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ PhaseX_Summary.txt         # Executive summary
â”œâ”€â”€ PhaseX_Metadata.csv        # Metadata for all outputs

File Types and Codes:
- TX = Text Synthesis / Summary
- DT = Structured Dataset (.csv)
- FG = Figure or Diagram (.svg or .png)
- Metadata = One .csv file logging every deliverable

Naming Convention:
P{Phase}.M{Module}.{Type}{##}_{ShortDescription}.{ext}
Example: P3_M1_TX01_ComparativeImpact.txt

METADATA REQUIREMENTS
----------------------
Each phase includes a PhaseX_Metadata.csv file with the following columns:
- Index Code
- Phase
- Module
- Type (TX, DT, FG)
- Title/Description
- File Name
- Source Category (ðŸŸ¢ A = peer-reviewed/institutional, ðŸŸ¡ B = gray literature, ðŸ”´ C = speculative/unverified)
- Notes

STANDARDS FOR WRITING AND SOURCES
----------------------------------
- Tone: Neutral, evidence-based, analytically rigorous.
- Style: Structured like a policy report or academic assessment.
- Sources: Only high-confidence sources are accepted (e.g., peer-reviewed meta-analyses, IPCC, FAO, WHO, etc.).
- Synthesis: All findings are provisional and specific to each phase â€” full conclusions deferred to Phase 8.
- Figures: Must be illustrative, high-level, and based on the cited data (no speculative visuals).

OUTPUT FORMAT EXPECTATIONS
---------------------------
- Deliver complete phases in a .zip with correct structure.
- Each module must address clearly specified subtopics.
- Summaries (e.g., Phase3_Summary.txt) must follow the format shown in Phase2_Summary.txt:
  - Title line
  - Protocol/date/modules metadata
  - Objective
  - Scope & Method
  - Key Findings
  - Implications

SESSION BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS
-------------------------------
- Only respond when work is done, unless intermediate steps are explicitly requested.
- Never skip metadata, structure, or packaging steps.
- Always log sources and explain assumptions.
- Remain consistent with templates from earlier phases (e.g., Phase 2 summary, metadata formatting).
