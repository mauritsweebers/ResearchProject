SESSION LOG ‚Äì Phase 2 Structuring, Metadata Integration, and Standardization

DATE: 2025-05-11
OBJECTIVE: Finalize Phase 2 outputs and integrate with project-wide metadata standards for SSOT compliance.

---

‚úîÔ∏è PHASE 2 STRUCTURE
- Created standardized module structure for Phase 2: module1‚Äìmodule5 with `data/` and `outputs/` subfolders.
- Populated each module with DT (Data Table), TX (Text Summary), and FG (Figure) deliverables.
- All outputs were named using the convention: P2_M{Module}_TYPEnn_{ShortDescriptor}.ext
- Summary file created: Phase2_Summary.txt
- Metadata file created: Phase2_Metadata.csv

---

üì¶ PHASE 2 ZIP ARCHIVE
- Phase 2 files were packaged into a ZIP: Phase2_Deliverables.zip
- Directory structure and filenames adhered to HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6

---

üßæ METADATA INTEGRATION
- Phase2_Metadata.csv integrated into Master_Index_Register.csv
- All columns matched existing structure, including:
  - `Index Code`, `Phase`, `Module`, `Type`, `Title/Description`, `File Name`, `Source Category`, `Notes`, `Location`, `Storage Location`

---

üõ† STANDARDIZATION RULES ESTABLISHED

1. `Type` Field Normalization:
   - Must use strict two-letter codes: TX, DT, FG
   - Variants like ‚ÄúTEXT OUTPUT‚Äù, ‚ÄúDATA TABLE‚Äù, etc. were mapped accordingly

2. `Storage Location` Field:
   - Must begin with `/ssot/`
   - Should include directory path only (no filename)
   - Format: `/ssot/phaseX/moduleY/(data|outputs)/`

3. `Notes` Field (Scientific Rigor Requirement):
   - Must go beyond simple source names
   - Should explain:
     - Source specificity (e.g. ‚ÄúPoore & Nemecek (2018)‚Äù)
     - Data purpose or use in model
     - Methodological context
   - Upgraded for all Phase 2 entries

4. `Location` Field:
   - Relative path inside phase folder
   - Format: `phaseX/moduleY/(data|outputs)/filename.ext`

---

üîÅ COMPARATIVE CHECKS PERFORMED
- Compared Phase 2 against Phase 1 and existing master metadata
- Verified conformity in:
  - Structural hierarchy
  - File naming schemes
  - Metadata field content and clarity

---

üß© LESSONS FOR FUTURE PHASES
- Always standardize `Type`, `Location`, `Storage Location`, and `Notes` fields on ingestion
- Use prior phase metadata as templates (Phase 1 and early Phase 0 entries are ideal models)
- Centralize path logic to avoid manual inconsistency
- Include interpretive and methodological context in Notes ‚Äî not just sources

---

‚úÖ FINAL DELIVERABLES
- Phase2_Summary.txt (rewritten to match Phase 1 style)
- Phase2_Metadata.csv (with enhanced Notes and correct structure)
- Master_Index_Register_Phase2_EnhancedNotes.csv (updated master metadata)
- Phase2_Deliverables.zip (containing all compliant outputs)

This log should be attached to all future metadata assembly tasks as a quickstart compliance guide.
