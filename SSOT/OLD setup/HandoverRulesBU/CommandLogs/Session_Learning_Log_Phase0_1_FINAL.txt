SESSION LEARNING LOG â€“ PHASE 0 & 1 FINALIZATION

âœ… CORE INFRASTRUCTURE ESTABLISHED

1. HTML rendering is now local.
   - No further HTML synthesis is performed by the assistant.
   - All rendering is executed via `HTML_Synthesis_Template_v1.5+`.

2. Protocols finalized and aligned:
   - HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6: Structural rules, dark mode, citations, theming
   - Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.4: Batch synthesis, file/folder layout, metadata enforcement

3. Renderer stack finalized and distributed:
   - Includes dark-mode compatible `render_metadata.py` using `.metadata-block`
   - Source table rendered as a structured <table> from `PhaseX_MasterSourceList.csv`
