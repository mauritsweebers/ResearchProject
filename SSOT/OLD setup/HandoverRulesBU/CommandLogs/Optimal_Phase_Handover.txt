✅ OPTIMAL PHASE HANDOVER PACKAGE
Purpose: Establish a unified, replicable protocol for structuring, delivering, and documenting all future research phases in the Plant-Based Systems project.

🧭 PROJECT FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

🎯 Overarching Goal
Determine if the global population can be supported on a nutritionally complete, ecologically viable, and socioeconomically feasible plant-based diet, analyzed through eight sequential research phases.

🔄 Research Phases
- Phase 0: Current System Analysis
- Phase 1: Nutritional Viability
- Phase 2: Agricultural Feasibility
- Phase 3: Environmental Impact
- Phase 4: Economic & Supply Chain Viability
- Phase 5: Cultural and Political Realities
- Phase 6: Transition Mechanisms
- Phase 7: Critique and Robustness Testing
- Phase 8: Synthesis and Scenario Modeling

📁 FILE AND FOLDER STRUCTURE

Each phase must follow this standardized directory architecture:

phaseX/
├── module1/
│   ├── data/        # .csv or .tsv files (DT)
│   └── outputs/     # text (.txt) or figures (.png/.svg)
├── module2/
│   └── ...
├── PhaseX_Summary.txt        # executive synthesis
├── PhaseX_Metadata.csv       # all file records

🧾 File Naming Convention
P{Phase}.M{Module}.{Type}{NN}_{ShortDescriptor}.{ext}
Example: P3_M1_TX01_ComparativeImpact.txt

🗂 File Types
- TX = Text Summary
- DT = Data Table (.csv)
- FG = Figure (.png or .svg)

📑 METADATA COMPLIANCE

✅ Required Columns (PhaseX_Metadata.csv)
- Index Code
- Phase
- Module
- Type (TX, DT, FG)
- Title/Description
- File Name
- Source Category (🟢 A, 🟡 B, 🔴 C)
- Notes

✅ Standard Fields Behavior
- Type: Strict two-letter code (TX, DT, FG only)
- Location: Relative path from phase root (e.g., phase3/module1/outputs/P3_M1_TX01_ComparativeImpact.txt)
- Storage Location: SSOT-compliant path (e.g., /ssot/phase3/module1/outputs/)

🧠 WRITING & EVIDENCE STANDARDS

✒️ Style & Tone
- Structured, neutral, and academically rigorous
- Suitable for interdisciplinary policy, sustainability, or scientific reports

🔍 Source Requirements
- Peer-reviewed meta-analyses
- IPCC, FAO, WHO, UNEP, World Bank
- Integrated Assessment Models (IMAGE, GCAM)

📉 Figures
- Must illustrate high-level system interactions
- Avoid speculative visuals
- All figures must be linked to cited models or datasets

🔁 PROCESS & BEHAVIORAL NORMS

- Respond only after full task completion, unless prompted otherwise
- Each module must address distinct sub-questions or system components
- Always generate:
  - Metadata file (CSV)
  - Executive summary (TXT)
  - Correct module structure (folders)
- Validate internal consistency against prior phases (esp. Phase 1 and 2)

🔧 LESSONS FROM PHASE 2

From Phase2_Session_Log.txt:
- Use Notes fields for methodological context, not just citations
- Apply normalized Type, Location, and Storage Location conventions
- Centralize and standardize all paths using relative formatting
- Reuse successful metadata and file structures as templates
