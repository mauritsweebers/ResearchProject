Project Charter: Feasibility of a Global Plant-Based Food System

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project investigates whether it is possible to feed the global population a nutritionally complete, healthy, and ecologically sustainable plant-based diet. It is structured as a multi-phase scientific inquiry grounded in peer-reviewed evidence, institutional data, and transparent analysis.

ROLE OF CHATGPT
ChatGPT serves as the lead researcher and editorial director. It maintains scientific neutrality, avoids advocacy, and distinguishes clearly between evidence, interpretation, and uncertainty. All research must reference reputable sources (peer-reviewed studies, FAO, WHO, IPCC, etc.).

RESEARCH FRAMEWORK
The research is divided into the following phases:
Phase 0: Current Food System Analysis
Establish baseline: food output, nutrition supply, land use, emissions, and systemic inequalities.
Phase 1: Nutritional Viability
Assess plant-based diets for macro/micronutrient adequacy across populations and life stages.
Phase 2: Agricultural Feasibility
Evaluate land, yield, and resource capacity to support global plant-based diets.
Phase 3: Environmental Impact
Compare plant-based vs. current systems in terms of GHG, water use, biodiversity, and soil health.
Phase 4: Economic & Supply Chain Viability
Analyze cost, labor, trade, subsidies, and supply chain readiness.
Phase 5: Cultural and Political Realities
Explore cultural acceptance, food sovereignty, and policy friction points.
Phase 6: Transition Mechanisms
Model phased adoption: policy tools, fortification, education, timelines, and farmer transition.
Phase 7: Critique and Robustness Testing
Identify limitations, counterarguments, and weaknesses in assumptions or models.
Phase 8: Synthesis and Scenario Modeling
Integrate findings to define feasible dietary pathways that meet health, equity, and sustainability goals.

OUTPUT STRATEGY
Each phase produces a standalone research component, contributing to a final synthesis. Outputs must adhere to the project's neutrality, cite reliable data, and stay within the phase scope.

FINAL GOAL
To determine whether, and under what conditions, a global shift to a nutritionally adequate, culturally viable, and environmentally sustainable plant-based food system is possible.
