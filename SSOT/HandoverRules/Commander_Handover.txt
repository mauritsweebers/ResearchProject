Commander Execution Rules – Phase 0 to 3
========================================

Issued by: Project Director
Applies to: Command Center Operations and Phase Oversight

------------------------------------------------------------
1. PROMPT CONTROL
------------------------------------------------------------
- Only the Commander issues full-phase prompts (not modular or speculative).
- Prompts must follow the Phase_Chat_Prompt_Template structure.
- Each directive must result in a full `.zip` package returned by the Phase Chat.
- Prompts must enforce inclusion of metadata and summary files.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. PHASE HANDOVER MANDATES
------------------------------------------------------------
- Upon phase completion, the Commander:
  • Validates all deliverables against metadata
  • Generates PhaseX_QA_Log.csv
  • Confirms structural compliance (SSOT rules)
  • Appends validated entries to Master_Index_Register.csv
  • Prepares and exports PhaseX_Handover_Log.txt
  • Prepares a consolidated QA + Research Quality Assessment if spanning multiple phases

------------------------------------------------------------
3. QA RESPONSIBILITIES
------------------------------------------------------------
- The Commander must:
  • Ensure metadata and file contents match exactly
  • Reject or flag any unregistered or misplaced files
  • Record findings in a consistent QA format
- QA log entries must include: index code, file name, type, source category, file found, and notes

------------------------------------------------------------
4. BATCH ENFORCEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------
- Commander workflows must treat every phase as a batch process:
  • All outputs from a phase must be received together
  • Partial updates or fragmented submissions are not accepted
- No HTML rendering or file repair is done during the QA process

------------------------------------------------------------
5. ARCHIVAL AND VERSIONING
------------------------------------------------------------
- Each validated phase is zipped with all deliverables and logs
- Zip file: phaseX_validated_package.zip
- Rules, protocols, and handovers must be versioned and exportable as .txt
- Every QA pass must be accompanied by a downloadable log and, if spanning multiple phases, a cumulative synthesis summary

------------------------------------------------------------
6. QUALITY AND INTEGRITY REVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------
- Commander assesses whether:
  • Each phase output demonstrates analytical seriousness
  • Findings are traceable to valid sources
  • Summary conclusions are supported by metadata-linked data

- Reports lacking traceability, quantification, or source detail must be revised or annotated

------------------------------------------------------------
7. HANDOFF STANDARDS
------------------------------------------------------------
- Before transition to a new phase or Commander unit:
  • Session Execution Rules must be issued as `Session_Execution_Rules_PhaseX.txt`
  • Commander instructions must be issued as `Commander_Execution_Rules_PhaseX.txt`
  • QA logs and summary reports must be zipped or logged

------------------------------------------------------------
Compliance:
All Phase Chat and Command workflows must conform to these rules unless explicitly superseded by a future version of Unified_Command_Protocol.
