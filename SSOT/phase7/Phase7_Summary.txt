PHASE 7 – Internal Audit, Stress Testing, and Robustness Layer (Final)

Date Finalized: 2025-05-28
Modules: 4 | Deliverables: 8

Objective:
To audit the internal logic, coherence, and stress resilience of the entire Global Plant-Based System model from Phases 0 through 6. Phase 7 identifies weak points, assumptions under pressure, and sensitivity patterns that influence outcomes.

Scope & Method:
Each module focuses on a different audit dimension:
- M1: Sensitivity of outputs to key parameter shifts (land, price, yield, fortification, labor)
- M2: Evidence gaps and unverified assumptions across empirical layers
- M3: Risk matrix construction identifying cumulative failure vectors and interaction effects
- M4: Critical policy and ethical review, equity overlays, and realism checks

Key Findings:
- High model sensitivity observed in protein availability under yield variation, labor-income shifts, and cultural resistance scores
- Evidence gaps remain in informal labor dynamics, micro-scale trade responses, and cultural narrative modeling
- Interacting risks (e.g., low state capacity + high trade dependency) generate non-linear system failure risks
- Political feasibility remains fragile in 22% of population-weighted countries without significant institutional reform

Conclusion:
Phase 7 confirms that the core model is structurally coherent but operates under several material sensitivities and known data limits. Outputs here are required for Phase 8 feasibility scoring, and for guarding against overconfidence in scenario synthesis.

Module 1 assumptions updated to reference corrected nutrient yields from P2_M1_DT01_CropAllocation_CORRECTED.csv. Other modules unaffected.
