PHASE 7 – Critique and Robustness Testing
Protocol: HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6
Date Finalized: 2025-05-11
Modules: 4 | Deliverables: 8

Objective:
To test the robustness, generalizability, and potential failure modes of prior findings (Phases 1–6), including underlying assumptions, variable sensitivities, domain limitations, and known counterarguments.

Scope & Method:
Phase 7 is organized across four modules: assumption audits and model sensitivity (Module 1), evidence gaps and empirical contradictions (Module 2), external risks and system fragilities (Module 3), and cross-disciplinary critique and dissent (Module 4). Sources include IPCC, FAO, peer-reviewed critiques, and institutional data divergences.

Key Findings:
- Modeling Assumptions: Key variables such as yield, substitution ratios, and nutrient bioavailability carry wide sensitivity ranges and idealized assumptions.
- Data Conflicts: Conflicting institutional data (e.g., FAO vs. WB) challenge uniform surplus or undernourishment claims.
- Systemic Risks: Climate instability, trade chokepoints, and infrastructure inertia pose credible threats to a smooth transition.
- Dissent: Political ecologists and rural economists raise valid concerns around sovereignty, equity, and top-down reform risks.

Implications:
The transition to a plant-based global food system, while plausible and beneficial in aggregate, is highly contingent on uncertain parameters, region-specific risks, and pluralistic social realities. These critiques and failure modes will inform the final synthesis and scenario testing in Phase 8.
