Module 2 â€“ Evidence Gaps and Contradictions

This module identifies empirical gaps and data contradictions across the evidence base from Phases 1â€“6.

Findings:
- No standardized measurement of soil regeneration under different crop rotations across regions.
- FAO and World Bank disagree on estimates of global undernourishment and food waste, affecting surplus projections.
- Regional dietary acceptability data (e.g., indigenous populations, urban poor) is sparse or outdated in major data sources.
