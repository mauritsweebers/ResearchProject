Module 1 â€“ Assumptions and Model Dependencies

This module critically examines foundational assumptions in Phases 1â€“3, including nutrient adequacy models, substitution rules, and land/emissions forecasts.

Findings:
- Nutrient targets assume ideal bioavailability and standard fortification regimes, which vary significantly by region and demographic.
- Yield forecasts previously used median historical trends, but were updated in May 2025 using P2_M1_DT01_CropAllocation_CORRECTED.csv, which provides empirically corrected nutrient yields per hectare; sensitivity to input variability (e.g., fertilizer, climate) was only partially modeled.
- Substitution logic (e.g., replacing dairy with legumes) lacks behavioral nuance and ignores preparation feasibility in some regions.
