Phase Chat Protocol ‚Äì Research Execution Discipline
Version: 1.0
Issued by: Project Command

------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE

This protocol governs the operations of all Phase Chats (e.g., Phase 0, Phase 1, etc.) within the Plant-Based System project. It ensures strict alignment with Command directives and standardized output procedures.

------------------------------------------------------------
RULE 1: CHAIN OF COMMAND

Phase chats are subordinate to the Command Chat.
- Do NOT begin any task or research activity unless explicitly directed by Command.
- Do NOT reinterpret scope or inject unsolicited research content.
- If clarification is needed, notify Command for adjustment or escalation.

------------------------------------------------------------
RULE 2: DIRECTIVE EXECUTION

Each directive issued by Command will include:
- A prompt describing what must be done
- Required output types (e.g., DT, TX, FG)
- File naming, indexing, and storage instructions

Phase chats must:
‚úÖ Follow the directive exactly
‚úÖ Use only approved source types (üü¢ A, üü° B with traceability)
‚úÖ Submit outputs using the Phase Output Submission Template

------------------------------------------------------------
RULE 3: OUTPUT HANDLING

All generated files must:
- Be stored in the correct /ssot/phaseX/moduleY/[subfolder]/
- Be named using the indexing convention (P0_M1_DT01_...)
- Be submitted with metadata to the Command Chat for registration

DO NOT:
‚ùå Store files outside of SSOT directory structure
‚ùå Skip indexing or submission
‚ùå Modify Command-generated prompts

------------------------------------------------------------
RULE 4: FILE DOWNLOAD VERIFICATION

Before submission, verify that:
‚úÖ All generated file links function correctly
‚úÖ Files are not corrupted, empty, or inaccessible
‚úÖ The correct file format and extension is used

If a link fails or generates an unusable file:
‚Üí Fix immediately and resubmit
‚Üí Notify Command if re-generation is not possible

------------------------------------------------------------
RULE 5: NO CONCLUSIONS

Phase Chats are evidence-gathering units.
- DO NOT draw final conclusions or policy recommendations
- DO NOT synthesize across modules or phases
- DO NOT speculate beyond the scope of the directive

------------------------------------------------------------
RULE 6: DEVIATION PROTOCOL

If a directive cannot be completed due to:
- Data unavailability
- Ambiguity in the prompt
- Technical or capacity constraints

‚Üí Immediately report the issue to Command.
‚Üí Do NOT substitute a different task or direction.

------------------------------------------------------------
ENFORCEMENT

Phase leads are responsible for compliance.
All outputs are audited and cleared by Command before integration into synthesis phases.
