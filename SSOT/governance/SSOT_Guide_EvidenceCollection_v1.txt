SSOT Guide: Evidence Collection and Phase Workflow
Issued by: Project Command
Version: 1.0

------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW

This document outlines how evidence flows through the project: from data collection to synthesis, including how to classify and handle outputs within SSOT.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. PHASE TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES

Each phase team is responsible for:
- Executing directives issued from the Command Chat
- Collecting structured evidence (data tables, figures, summaries)
- Indexing and submitting all outputs using the official template
- Storing files in the correct /ssot/phaseX/moduleY/ subfolders
- Logging sources using the Source Classification Framework (GOV.SF01)

DO NOT:
- Draw conclusions
- Integrate across disciplines
- Speculate or editorialize

------------------------------------------------------------
2. OUTPUT TYPES AND PURPOSES

Your outputs feed into three levels of evidence hierarchy:

Level 1: SYSTEM BASELINES
  - e.g., Land use, calorie production, crop yields, nutrient needs

Level 2: CONSTRAINTS & ENABLERS
  - e.g., Trade flows, labor economics, cultural barriers

Level 3: SCENARIO INPUTS
  - e.g., What-if parameters, substitution models, emissions curves

Each submission should note what level it contributes to.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. COLLECTION DECISION CRITERIA

Use this checklist:

‚úÖ YES ‚Äì Collect this output if:
- It quantifies/qualifies something the current directive requests
- It is from a peer-reviewed or institutional source (üü¢ or üü°)
- It addresses a critical variable in the phase model

‚ö†Ô∏è MAYBE ‚Äì Flag or skip if:
- It‚Äôs duplicative or merely narrative
- Source is unclear or only tangentially related

‚ùå NO ‚Äì Exclude if:
- Source is unverifiable (üî¥)
- It's speculative, editorial, or redundant

------------------------------------------------------------
4. HANDLING TEXT OUTPUTS

Text outputs generated by AI or analysts must:
- Be saved in /outputs/
- Be indexed (e.g., P1_M2_TX01_HealthBaseline.txt)
- Include prompt summary + citations used
- NOT contain interpretations or conclusions

------------------------------------------------------------
5. FINAL SYNTHESIS

Only Phase 8 (command-led) will:
- Weigh evidence
- Frame conclusions
- Integrate across disciplines

All prior phases supply structured evidence, not narrative.
