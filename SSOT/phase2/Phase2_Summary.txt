PHASE 2 â€“ Agricultural Feasibility of Nutrient-Sufficient Plant-Based Diets (Revised)

Date Finalized: 2025-05-28
Modules: 5 (M1â€“M5) | Status: M2â€“M4 Re-executed, M1 & M5 Legacy-Valid

Objective:
To determine whether the global agricultural system can feasibly supply nutrient-adequate, plant-based diets under real-world land, yield, and ecological constraints.

Scope & Method:
Phase 2 evaluates agricultural feasibility by examining crop performance across agroecological zones, yield potential, and land trade-offs. Modules 2â€“4 were revalidated using FAO yield datasets, GAEZ crop models, and water/emissions trade-off estimates. Modules 1 and 5 are retained as legacy-valid.

Key Metrics and Findings:
- âœ… **kcal/hectare**: Optimized plant-based crop combinations can exceed 14,000 kcal/ha/day in temperate zones.
- âœ… **Protein/hectare**: Legume-rich systems (soy, lentils, chickpeas) yield >1,200g/ha/day protein under optimal conditions.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Land use per dietary unit**: Plant-based systems require 50â€“70% less land per dietary RDI than mixed or animal-based systems.
- âš  **AEZ trade-offs**: Feasibility variesâ€”subtropical and temperate AEZs show high yield convergence, while arid regions require either drought-resistant crops or trade integration.
- âš  **Yield gaps**: Africa and South Asia remain limited by low input/output ratios; targeted intervention is required.

Module Highlights:
- **M2 (Yield Feasibility by AEZ)**: Confirms climatically suitable crops vary by region, necessitating diversified portfolios.
- **M3 (System Trade-offs)**: Recalibrated data show trade-offs between protein density, water use, and GHGs; mixed cereal-legume systems perform best.
- **M4 (Regional Yield Potential)**: Confirms >30% yield variability across regions; overlay maps support geographically optimized planning.

Conclusion:
Phase 2 affirms that agricultural feasibility is achievable globally but not uniformly. Nutrient-dense, plant-based production is viable with region-specific strategies, yield-gap interventions, and resource-aware cropping systems.

Notes:
- M1 (nutrient-per-hectare allocation) and M5 (system risk profiles) retained as scope-valid but not revalidated.
