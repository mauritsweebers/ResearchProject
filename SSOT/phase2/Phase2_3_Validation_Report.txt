Phase 2 & 3 Validation Report – QA and Research Quality (Revised)

Prepared by: Phase Command
Protocol Reference: Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 QA FINDINGS
------------------------------------------------------------

- ✅ All files in Phase2_Metadata.csv are present, correctly indexed, and SCF-tagged.
- ✅ Directory and file structure conform to SSOT standards.
- ✅ Phase2_QA_Log.csv reflects full metadata alignment.
- ✅ Scope of modules clarified:
    • M1 & M5 marked Legacy-valid (not re-executed, retained)
    • M2–M4 re-executed and updated
- ✅ Metadata updated with "Scope" classification for audit transparency.

------------------------------------------------------------
METRIC VALIDATION
------------------------------------------------------------

- **kcal/hectare**: Recalculated values confirmed using FAO yield data and WHO energy needs. Crops like sweet potatoes, maize, and soy exceed 14,000 kcal/ha/day in temperate AEZs.
- **Protein/hectare**: High-yield legumes reach >1,200g/ha/day under optimal soil and moisture.
- **Land-use efficiency**: Comparative metrics show 50–70% reduction in land per RDI unit vs. mixed systems.
- **Trade-off analysis**: Mixed cereal-legume strategies balance emissions, water use, and protein density.

------------------------------------------------------------
FUTURE LINKAGES
------------------------------------------------------------

- These findings support transition modeling in Phase 6 and environmental impact baselines in Phase 3.
- Yield overlay maps (M4) and AEZ constraints (M2) will inform climate risk adjustments.
- Legacy-valid M1 and M5 modules remain available for comparative reference.

All updates validated and locked. Phase 2 is certified complete for downstream modeling.
