## Land Use Overview

- Global agricultural land totals approximately 4.9 billion hectares.
- Roughly 68% of this land is used as permanent pasture for grazing livestock (~3.3 billion ha).
- The remaining 32% (1.6 billion ha) is arable land used for crops.
- Of crop land:
  - ~55% is used for direct human consumption.
  - ~36% is used to grow animal feed.
  - ~9% is used for biofuels or industrial purposes.

## Water Use Patterns

- Agriculture accounts for ~2,500 kmÂ³/year of freshwater withdrawals, or about 70% of total global use.
- About 330 million hectares are irrigated (~20% of cropland), providing ~40% of global food output.
- Water intensity varies significantly:
  - Plant-based foods (e.g., cereals, pulses): 790â€“1,300 mÂ³/tonne
  - Animal-based foods (e.g., beef, dairy): 4,000â€“15,400 mÂ³/tonne

## Nitrogen Fertilizer Use

- Global synthetic nitrogen use in agriculture is ~110 million tonnes N/year.
- Usage by category:
  - Cereals: ~60% of total N (especially maize, rice, wheat)
  - Oil crops: ~15%
  - Fruits and vegetables: ~10%
  - Feed crops: ~50% (substantial overlap with cereal allocation)

## Key Takeaways

- The vast majority of global land and water inputs are devoted to livestock systems, directly (pasture) or indirectly (feed crops).
- Resource use efficiency is markedly higher for plant-based foods across all biophysical metrics.
- These baselines will serve as quantitative inputs for modeling the ecological limits and efficiencies of alternative dietary scenarios in Phases 3 and 4.
