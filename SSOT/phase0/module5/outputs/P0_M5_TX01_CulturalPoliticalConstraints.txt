## 1. Religious and Cultural Constraints

- Religious dietary laws shape global food preferences:
  - Islam and Judaism prohibit pork and require specific slaughter methods (Halal, Kosher).
  - Hindu-majority areas avoid beef and favor vegetarian diets.
  - Buddhist-influenced populations restrict animal product consumption.
  - Christian fasting periods (Orthodox, Catholic) affect seasonal consumption patterns.

- Cultural traditions maintain persistent attachment to meat as a status symbol or festive necessity.
- Secular diet shifts (e.g., veganism) remain concentrated in specific socioeconomic and regional contexts.

## 2. National Political Economies

- Many governments are structurally dependent on animal agriculture:
  - The US, Brazil, and EU maintain powerful livestock lobbies and entrenched subsidy structures.
  - BRICS nations blend protectionism with strategic food security planning (e.g., India's MSP, China's pork reserve).

- Food regimes are embedded in broader state-market compacts:
  - Brazilâ€™s livestock and soy economy is deeply linked to export revenue and rural political power.
  - EUâ€™s Common Agricultural Policy supports environmental reform but maintains livestock support.
  - China and Russia emphasize food sovereignty and domestic control over key proteins.

## 3. Transformation Barriers

- Political resistance to dietary change is not only cultural but economic:
  - Job losses, trade realignments, and rural opposition form high-friction barriers.
- National identity, sovereignty, and religious autonomy frequently conflict with standardized food transition narratives.
- Any proposed plant-based transformation must engage with this fragmented and politicized landscape.
