## 1. Production & Caloric Flow (Module 1)

- ~9.6 billion tonnes of primary crops produced globally, alongside 361 Mt of meat and 930 Mt of milk.
- Plant-based foods supply ~82% of global dietary calories, yet a third of crop calories are redirected to animal feed.
- Top caloric contributors include rice, wheat, and sugar crops. Top producers: China, US, Brazil, India.

## 2. Food Losses & Waste (Module 2)

- An estimated 1.3 billion tonnesâ€”~33% of all foodâ€”is lost or wasted annually.
- Losses in LMICs are concentrated in early supply chain stages (harvest/storage); in HICs, waste is dominant at retail/consumer levels.
- Fruits, vegetables, and cereals are the most affected commodities.

## 3. Resource Allocation (Module 3)

- 4.9 billion ha of land used for agriculture; 68% of this is pasture.
- Water use in agriculture totals ~2,500 kmÂ³ annually; 330 million ha of irrigated land produces ~40% of food.
- 110 Mt/year of synthetic nitrogen is applied, primarily to cereals and feed crops.
- Animal-based systems dominate land, water, and nitrogen use.

## 4. Trade and Economic Structure (Module 4)

- Global food trade is dominated by a few commodities (e.g., soy, wheat, beef) and actors (Brazil, US, EU, China).
- Major agricultural subsidies reach $90B (EU) to $180B (China), often reinforcing livestock and staple crop systems.
- The food economy is highly concentrated, with four firms handling most global grain trade (ABCD group).

## 5. Cultural and Political Constraints (Module 5)

- Religious norms (e.g., Halal, Kosher, vegetarianism) impose hard dietary boundaries in ~60% of the global population.
- National food regimes reflect entrenched political and economic interests, especially around livestock sectors.
- High resistance zones include India, USA, Brazil, Iran, and parts of Eastern Europe and Africa.

This synthesis provides the integrated system-level baseline for downstream scenario modeling, constraint evaluation, and transition pathway assessment (Phase 1 onward).
