Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.3

📘 Purpose:
Streamline phase synthesis and validation while ensuring protocol compliance, traceability, and system-wide integrity.

---

🔁 Phase Execution Mode (Batch Synthesis):

All module outputs in a phase are synthesized externally and delivered in a single batch folder. My responsibilities begin post-delivery.

The batch must include:
- ✅ One `.txt` per TX deliverable
- ✅ One `.csv` per DT
- ✅ One `.svg` or `.png` per FG
- ✅ One `.txt` or `.csv` file containing **complete metadata for all deliverables**

---

🧾 Metadata Enforcement:

- All metadata must follow the protocol fields: Index Code, Phase, Module, Type, Title/Description, File Name, Source Category, Notes
- The metadata file must be included in the downloadable `.zip` folder alongside the data files
- The metadata will be validated and then appended to the Master_Index_Register.csv after QA passes

---

🔍 QA Responsibilities:

- ✅ Check filename and path compliance (HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6)
- ✅ Confirm all listed metadata files are present in the batch
- ✅ Ensure all file types are protocol-aligned and parse correctly
- ❌ Do not fix missing, corrupted, or misnamed files
- ❌ Do not assume metadata — it must be explicitly provided

---

📁 Logging and Index Integration:

- After QA, validated metadata will be appended to the Master_Index_Register.csv
- A QA log will be generated, summarizing file presence, path validity, and integration status

---

🧠 Phase Chat Directive Update:

All future Phase prompts **must include** this rule:
> “You must generate and include a full metadata file (`.txt` or `.csv`) listing all deliverables and their metadata. This file must be included in the downloadable `.zip` folder with the other files.”
