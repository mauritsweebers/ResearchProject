Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.1

📘 Purpose:
Coordinate all synthesis, validation, and delivery operations under reproducibility, enforcement, and delivery mandates.

---

🔒 HTML Synthesis Enforcement:
1. All outputs must comply with HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.7
2. Must use HTML_Synthesis_Template_v1.5+ and pass renderer validation
3. Appendix must be a structured source <table> (not list)
4. Visuals must support full theme toggle

---

📁 File Validation:
- HTML must be saved to /ssot/phaseX/logs/
- Hash computation required
- Naming: PhaseX_FullSynthesis_Final_vX.X_WithSummary_FIXEDPATH.html

---

📄 Master Source Enforcement:
- Appendix source table must include: Source Name, Type, Link/DOI, Cited In, Category, Status

---

🔁 Command Flow Adjustments:
- QA must verify visual accessibility and citation styling
- Only approved renderer versions may be used
- All protocol changes must generate downloadable text files

📥 Protocol Revision Delivery Requirement:
- Protocol changes must produce downloadable `.txt` files
- Naming format: Updated_Protocol_<Name>_vX.X.txt
- Required immediately after protocol change execution

🧾 Protocol File Naming Rule:
- Protocol filenames must retain consistent base names across all versions
- Only version number suffix (e.g., _v3.0, _v3.1) may change
- Disallowed: appending _FINAL, _UPDATED, etc.
- Example: Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.0.txt → Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.1.txt
