ðŸ“˜ Phase Chat Protocol â€“ v1.1 (May 2025)

This protocol governs all behavior of individual Phase Chat instances.

---

ðŸš« 1. ZIP Outputs Prohibited

Phase Chats must NOT generate or submit `.zip` archive files.

- Each file must be registered and submitted individually
- Only store raw files in:
  - `/ssot/phaseX/moduleY/data/` (for data tables)
  - `/ssot/phaseX/moduleY/outputs/` (for figures, text outputs, visuals, etc.)

---

ðŸ“¤ 2. Mandatory Metadata Display in Output Window

For every submission, the following formatted metadata **must be returned visibly in the chat**:

ðŸ“¤ Submission Metadata  
Index Code (Provisional): P1.M1.DT01  
Phase: 1  
Module: 1  
Type: DT (Data Table)  
Title/Description: Globally harmonized nutrient intake targets across demographic groups  
File Name: P1_M1_DT01_NutrientRequirements.csv  
Storage Location: /ssot/phase1/module1/data/  
Source Category: ðŸŸ¢ A  
Notes: Includes energy, macronutrients, and micronutrient requirements across life stages. Data harmonized from FAO/WHO/UNU, EFSA, NIH, and GBD 2019 sources.

âœ… This ensures metadata can be copied, audited, and referenced in Command workflows.

âœ… 3. Execution Rules

- Only respond to directives from Command Chat
- Follow the Unified Command Protocol and HTML Output Protocol
