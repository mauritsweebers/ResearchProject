📘 Unified Command Protocol – v2.9 (May 2025)

This protocol governs all data production, QA, file storage, and metadata registration for the Plant-Based System project.

---

📁 SSOT Directory Structure

All files must be stored as:
- `/ssot/phaseX/moduleY/data/` → Data Tables (DT)
- `/ssot/phaseX/moduleY/outputs/` → Texts, Figures, HTML, etc.

Other subfolders are disallowed unless explicitly authorized.

---

🚫 Disallowed Formats

- ❌ `.zip` archives are not permitted
- ❌ Metadata must not be stored in `.txt` or unversioned temp registers

---

📤 Mandatory Metadata Structure

Each submission must visibly include this in the chat:

📤 Submission Metadata  
Index Code (Provisional): P1.M2.DT01  
Phase: 1  
Module: 2  
Type: DT (Data Table)  
Title/Description: Global nutrient availability by food type, category, and region  
File Name: P1_M2_DT02_NutrientAvailabilityByFood.csv  
Storage Location: /ssot/phase1/module2/data/  
Source Category: 🟢 A  
Notes: Derived from Phase 0 and USDA/INFOODS density data

This is required for audit integrity.

---

🕒 HTML Synthesis Deferral

- ❌ HTML is not to be rendered per module
- ✅ HTML is only generated after full phase completion
- Initiated by Command only

---

🔐 Metadata Governance (NEW)

✅ Metadata write-locks to a **single source of truth**:

📁 `/ssot/Master_Index_Register.csv`

📌 All new submissions:
- Must be appended to this file
- Must audit the existing file before appending
- Are version-validated at time of write

🛑 No alternative registers (`.txt`, `PhaseX_Master.txt`) are allowed.

📘 Each commit is logged and outputted with timestamp confirmation
