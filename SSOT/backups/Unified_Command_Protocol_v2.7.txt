📘 Unified Command Protocol – Update v2.7 (May 2025)

This update applies to all current and future phases.

---

🚫 1. ZIP Outputs Prohibited

❌ `ZIP` is no longer an accepted file type.

- All files must be submitted individually.
- Valid types: `DT`, `TX`, `FG`, `IM`, `HTML`, etc.
- Bundled `.zip` archives must be removed from SSOT and excluded from metadata.

🗂 All outputs must be placed in:
- `/ssot/phaseX/moduleY/data/` — for data tables (DT)
- `/ssot/phaseX/moduleY/outputs/` — for figures, texts, HTML, and images

---

📤 2. Standardized Metadata Format Required in Output Window

Phase Chats must return metadata directly in the chat using this format:

📤 Submission Metadata  
Index Code (Provisional): P1.M1.DT01  
Phase: 1  
Module: 1  
Type: DT (Data Table)  
Title/Description: Globally harmonized nutrient intake targets across demographic groups  
File Name: P1_M1_DT01_NutrientRequirements.csv  
Storage Location: /ssot/phase1/module1/data/  
Source Category: 🟢 A  
Notes: Includes energy, macronutrients, and micronutrient requirements across life stages. Data harmonized from FAO/WHO/UNU, EFSA, NIH, and GBD 2019 sources.

🧾 This format must be visible in the chat history for auditing, not just inside documents or tables.

---

This protocol is mandatory for all Phase Chat outputs and Command validations.
