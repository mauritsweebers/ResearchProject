Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.4

📘 Purpose:
Enforce uniform Phase delivery structure, metadata placement, synthesis validation, and HTML rendering compliance.
Streamline phase synthesis and validation while ensuring protocol compliance, traceability, and system-wide integrity.

---

🔁 Phase Execution Mode – Batch Delivery:

All modules in a Phase must be synthesized externally and delivered as a structured folder. My responsibility begins after batch submission.

Deliverables must include:
- One `.txt` file per TX
- One `.csv` per DT
- One `.svg` or `.png` per FG
- One `PhaseX_Metadata.csv` or `.txt` file listing all deliverables

---

📂 Directory Structure and File Placement (Mandatory):

Phase folders must follow this structure:
```
phaseX/
├── module1/
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── P2_M1_DT01_*.csv
│   └── outputs/
│       ├── P2_M1_TX01_*.txt
│       └── P2_M1_FG01_*.svg
├── module2/
│   └── ...
├── PhaseX_Summary.txt
├── PhaseX_Metadata.csv
```

- All TX and FG files must be in `/outputs/`
- All DT files must be in `/data/`
- The metadata file must reside in the **root of the Phase folder**
- Only deliverables listed in the metadata file are accepted

---

🧾 Metadata Requirements:

- File must be named: `PhaseX_Metadata.csv` or `.txt`
- Must include all required fields:
  - `Index Code`, `Phase`, `Module`, `Type`, `Title/Description`, `File Name`, `Source Category`, `Notes`
- File is mandatory for synthesis validation and cannot be inferred

---

🧠 Phase Summary File:
- Must be named: `PhaseX_Summary.txt`
- Must appear at the top of the HTML output
- Must contain: Objective, Scope, Key Findings, Implications

---

📁 Logging:
- QA log is created for every accepted synthesis batch
- Validated metadata entries are appended to the Master_Index_Register.csv
- A QA log will be generated, summarizing file presence, path validity, and integration status


---

🔍 QA Responsibilities:

- ✅ Check filename and path compliance (HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6)
- ✅ Confirm all listed metadata files are present in the batch
- ✅ Ensure all file types are protocol-aligned and parse correctly
- ❌ Do not fix missing, corrupted, or misnamed files
- ❌ Do not assume metadata — it must be explicitly provided

---


🧠 Phase Chat Directive Update:

All future Phase prompts **must include** this rule:
> “You must generate and include a full metadata file (`.txt` or `.csv`) listing all deliverables and their metadata. This file must be included in the downloadable `.zip` folder with the other files.”
