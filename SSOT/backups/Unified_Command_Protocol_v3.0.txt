Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.0

📘 Purpose:
Direct all synthesis, transition, and validation operations in system-wide coordination — with full HTML output enforcement and traceability.

---

🔒 HTML Synthesis Enforcement:

1. All Phase synthesis outputs must comply with HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6
2. HTML must be rendered using HTML_Synthesis_Template_v1.5+ (includes .metadata-block and structured source table)
3. Renderer consistency must be validated before generation
4. Appendix must include structured source table from PhaseX_MasterSourceList.csv
5. Theme toggle, visual clarity, and contrast are mandatory

---

📁 File Validation:

- All HTML synthesis files must be logged to /ssot/phaseX/logs/
- A hash of the final output should be computed for reproducibility
- File name format: PhaseX_FullSynthesis_Final_vX.X_WithSummary_FIXEDPATH.html

---

📄 Master Source Enforcement:

- All Phase reports must include PhaseX_MasterSourceList.csv
- Required Columns: Source Name, Type, Link or DOI, Cited In, Category (A/B/C), Status
- Sources must be rendered as <table> not <ul>

---

✅ Command Flow Adjustments:

- HTML QA must verify theme, metadata, and citation styling visually
- Only approved renderer versions may be used in Phase execution
- Failure to comply results in rollback of synthesis attempt
