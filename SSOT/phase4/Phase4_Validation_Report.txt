PHASE 4 VALIDATION REPORT â€“ Economic Metrics Integrity and QA

Prepared: Phase Command
Reference: Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6

QA Findings:
- âœ… All files listed in Phase4_Metadata.csv are present and structurally valid.
- âœ… QA log is complete with 1:1 correspondence to metadata.
- âœ… All files conform to naming and index format rules.
- âœ… Source classification applied: all primary data tables are ðŸŸ¢ A or ðŸŸ¡ B.

Module Validity Summary:
- M1: Production cost and affordability metrics confirm plant-based advantages but highlight retail price gaps in LMICs.
- M2: Labor risk mapping reveals concentration in informal and gender-sensitive sectors.
- M3: Trade exposure scenarios validated using FAO and WTO elasticities and diversification indices.
- M4: Investment need estimates derived from historical reform transitions and modeled infrastructure projections.

Economic Model Notes:
- No price elasticity simulation included in Phase 4; elasticity will be layered in Phase 8 under scenario modeling.
- All findings stable under baseline commodity and wage assumptions.

Conclusion:
Phase 4 meets QA and economic modeling requirements. Outputs are cleared for Phase 6 policy feasibility integration and Phase 8 economic scenario stress testing.
