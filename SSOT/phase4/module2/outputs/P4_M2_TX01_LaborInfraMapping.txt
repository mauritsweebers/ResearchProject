Module 2 â€“ Labor & Infrastructure Requirements

This module evaluates regional labor intensity and infrastructural readiness for plant-based food systems. It utilizes FAO labor input datasets and World Bank infrastructure readiness indices.

Findings:
- Labor inputs for legume and cereal cultivation are significantly lower per kcal than animal husbandry.
- Processing infrastructure for legumes and grains is more evenly distributed than cold-chain systems for meat and dairy.
- Major infrastructure gaps exist in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia.
