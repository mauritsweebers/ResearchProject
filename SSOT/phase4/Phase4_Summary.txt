PHASE 4 – Economic Accessibility and Affordability of Plant-Based Reform (Final)

Date Finalized: 2025-05-28
Modules: 4 | Deliverables: 8

Objective:
To evaluate the affordability, labor integration, trade exposure, and investment transition costs associated with a shift to global plant-based dietary systems.

Scope & Method:
Phase 4 assesses how production costs, retail affordability, labor system risks, trade dependencies, and infrastructure reform interact with the feasibility of plant-based transition. Each module uses institutional cost databases (FAO, ILO, World Bank) and modeled dietary baselines to test exposure levels and system-wide resilience.

Key Findings:
- ✅ **Cost of Production**: Plant-based diets show 15–35% lower average commodity production costs compared to mixed systems; retail affordability varies by region.
- ✅ **Labor Exposure**: Informal agricultural labor accounts for >60% of workforce exposure in LMICs; high-risk transitions require job retraining and wage parity policies.
- ✅ **Trade Resilience**: Diversified trade networks lower exposure to supply shocks; however, protein substitution scenarios elevate risk in net food-importing regions.
- ✅ **Investment Needs**: Transition requires ~$200B global investment, split between public infrastructure and private market conversion.

Conclusion:
Plant-based transition is economically viable but must be regionally adapted to labor and trade sensitivities. Affordability gaps remain in low-income regions without subsidy, wage, or price reforms.
