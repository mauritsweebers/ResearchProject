PHASE 5 â€“ Cultural and Political Realities
Protocol: HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6
Date Finalized: 2025-05-11
Modules: 1 | Deliverables: 2

Objective:
To assess the political, cultural, and institutional conditions influencing receptivity to global plant-based dietary transitions. Focus was placed on ideological alignment, public trust, and cultural bias toward plant-forward systems.

Scope & Method:
Phase 5 constructed a two-part module: (1) dietary-cultural indicators and (2) trust/framing dynamics. Nine world regions were included. Religious framing, willingness to shift diets, and institutional trust indices were harmonized. A combined receptivity index was modeled to flag regions at risk of sociopolitical or ideological resistance.

Key Findings:
- South Asia and Oceania show high openness and trust alignment.
- Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa/Middle East are flagged for high receptivity risk.
- Cultural framing is more predictive than institutional trust in explaining divergence.
- The expanded dataset closed the regional coverage gap identified in Phase 9 QA.

Implications:
Cultural-institutional readiness varies widely and must be integrated into any global feasibility model. Regions with high resistance potential may require phased transitions or localized framing strategies.
