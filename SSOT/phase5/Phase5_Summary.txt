PHASE 5 â€“ Cultural and Political Realities
Protocol: HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6
Date Finalized: 2025-05-11
Modules: 4 | Deliverables: 8

Objective:
To assess the socio-cultural and political feasibility of shifting to a global plant-based food system. The phase focuses on identifying enabling conditions and resistance across cultural identities, political structures, legal environments, and public narratives.

Scope & Method:
Phase 5 comprises four modules: dietary identity and cultural foodways (Module 1), political economy and agribusiness lobbying (Module 2), legal and regulatory constraints (Module 3), and public discourse and media framing (Module 4). Data sources include Pew Research, FAOLEX, WTO notifications, and IPES-Food media analysis. Deliverables include synthesis texts (TX), region-specific indicator datasets (DT), and compliance metadata.

Key Findings:
- Cultural Framing: Deep-rooted cultural identities shape dietary choices, but many traditions already support or accommodate plant-based foods.
- Political Resistance: Institutional inertia and lobbying from legacy meat/dairy sectors slow transition efforts, particularly in the US and EU.
- Legal Barriers: Food labeling restrictions and subsidy imbalances persist, although international norms (e.g., WTO) are increasingly scrutinized.
- Public Trust: Effective framing (e.g., health/climate) outperforms ethical appeals. Trust in food authorities varies sharply by region.

Implications:
Cultural and political factors represent critical determinants in the pace and nature of dietary transitions. While barriers exist, alignment of public messaging, institutional support, and culturally resonant framings can significantly enhance acceptability. The findings inform scenario design and stakeholder mapping in Phase 6.
