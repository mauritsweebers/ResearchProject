PHASE 5 VALIDATION REPORT â€“ Sociopolitical Risk Model QA

Prepared by: Phase Command
Reference: Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6

QA Summary:
- âœ… All files in Phase5_Metadata.csv are present and validated
- âœ… QA log 100% complete and compliant with metadata
- âœ… SCF classification used: All data ðŸŸ¢ A (institutional) or ðŸŸ¡ B (traceable public indices)
- âœ… File naming and indexing follow P5.MX.TY## convention

Model Integrity:
- Composite scoring updated to reflect weighted averages of cultural, political, and institutional dimensions
- Normalization: country-level metrics scaled 0â€“100 per indicator
- Thresholds for high-risk classification confirmed via expert median judgment and political risk indices (WGI, Varieties of Democracy, Pew Research)

Assumptions:
- Resistance vectors not independent: compound fragility increases risk non-linearly
- Lobby exposure treated as political amplifier, not stand-alone barrier
- Cultural score assumes inertia unless targeted with narrative interventions (to be designed in Phase 6)

Conclusion:
Phase 5 risk surfaces are robust and aligned with system-wide modeling. Data validated for transition pathway input in Phase 6 and stress testing in Phase 8.

[Validation Extension â€“ v1.1]
Confirmed compatibility with corrected nutrient yields from P2_M1_DT01_CropAllocation_CORRECTED.csv. Models structurally sound.
