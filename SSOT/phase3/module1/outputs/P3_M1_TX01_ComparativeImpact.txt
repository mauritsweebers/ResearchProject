Comparative Environmental Impacts of Plant-Based vs Conventional Diets

A shift toward plant-based diets significantly reduces environmental impacts across key dimensions:

1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Global adoption of vegan diets could cut food-related GHGs by up to 70% (Poore & Nemecek, 2018). Ruminant meats have emission intensities >20x that of legumes per gram of protein.

2. Land Use: Livestock accounts for 77% of global agricultural land but provides only 18% of calories. Transitioning to plant-based diets could free ~3 billion hectares (Poore & Nemecek, 2018).

3. Water Use: Animal products are water-intensive. A plant-based diet uses ~50% less freshwater per capita (Clark et al., 2019).

4. Eutrophication: Manure and feed crops contribute heavily to nutrient pollution. A plant-based shift cuts eutrophication potential by >50%.

5. Biodiversity: Dietary shifts reduce pressures from pasture expansion and feed crop monocultures. IPBES reports note plant-based diets are consistent with biodiversity protection goals.
