Phase;Title;Objectives;Inputs;Outputs
Phase0;Current Food System Analysis;Establish a detailed baseline of the global food system's structure, outputs, and impacts.;FAO stats, IPCC reports, World Bank data, nutrient supply datasets, trade databases;Quantified baseline: food production, land use, emissions, nutrient supply, inequities, waste
Phase1;Nutritional Viability;Assess whether a plant-based diet can meet nutritional needs for all life stages and populations.;WHO/FAO dietary requirements, nutrient bioavailability data, clinical and population studies;"Nutrient adequacy models by demographic; critical nutrients identified; variance analysis"
Phase2;Agricultural Feasibility;Evaluate global agricultural capacity to support a plant-based food system.;Crop yield data, land suitability maps, FAO agricultural production stats;"Scenarios for plant-based yields; land use estimates; regional production constraints"
Phase3;Environmental Impact;Quantify environmental outcomes of plant-based vs. current systems.;LCA databases, GHG and water footprint literature, biodiversity metrics;"Comparative environmental impacts by system type; hotspot analysis"
Phase4;Economic & Supply Chain Viability;Analyze economic feasibility and infrastructure readiness for transition.;Cost of production models, trade flow data, labor stats, subsidy reports;"Economic viability maps; supply chain gap analysis; policy cost estimates"
Phase5;Cultural and Political Realities;Explore social, political, and cultural limits and levers of dietary change.;Sociological surveys, political economy studies, cultural dietary data;"Cultural adoption barriers; sovereignty conflicts; transition sensitivities"
Phase6;Transition Mechanisms;Map practical tools, interventions, and timelines for systemic change.;Policy case studies, tech readiness data, fortification feasibility;"Transition timelines; toolkits; risks and co-benefit strategies"
Phase7;Critique and Robustness Testing;Identify limitations, counterarguments, and uncertainties in the findings.;Critical literature, scenario stress-tests, interdisciplinary review;"Boundaries of confidence; critical weaknesses; resilience score"
Phase8;Synthesis and Scenario Modeling;Integrate validated findings into final conclusions and dietary scenarios.;All validated outputs from Phases 0â€“7;"Sustainable dietary models; planetary compatibility; policy recommendations"
