This document outlines the methodology used in Phase 1 â€“ Module 5 to develop a matrix of nutrient synergies and inhibitors relevant to plant-based diets.

1. OBJECTIVE
To identify and catalog nutrient-nutrient and nutrient-compound interactions that significantly enhance or inhibit bioavailability within a dietary context.

2. SOURCES
This analysis draws from:
- WHO/FAO Expert Consultations on human nutrient requirements (2001, 2004)
- EFSA scientific opinions on mineral bioavailability and upper intake levels
- NIH Office of Dietary Supplements
- Peer-reviewed sources including:
  - Etcheverry et al. (2012) on mineral inhibitors
  - Hurrell et al. (2003) on iron absorption
  - Scholz-Ahrens et al. (2007) on calcium and prebiotics

3. INTERACTIONS INCLUDED
- Synergistic: Vitamin C with non-heme iron; prebiotics with calcium/magnesium; carotenoids enhancing vitamin A status
- Inhibitory: Phytates, polyphenols, oxalates, fiber-polyphenol complexes; nutrient-nutrient competition (e.g., iron/zinc, calcium/magnesium)

4. CATEGORIZATION
Each interaction entry includes:
- Affected nutrient
- Modulating compound or co-nutrient
- Direction of effect (synergy or inhibition)
- Mechanistic description (e.g., solubility, binding, conversion)
- Estimated effect size range (qualitative and/or quantitative)
- Primary source reference

5. LIMITATIONS
- Interaction strengths are derived from typical ranges across studies and may vary with matrix, food form, and dose
- Does not yet include meal-level simulation or dietary pattern analysis
