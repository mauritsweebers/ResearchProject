This document outlines the methodology used in Phase 1 â€“ Module 2 to estimate global nutrient availability from current food production.

1. INPUT DATA
Five validated datasets from Phase 0 Module 1 were used:
- P0_M1_DT01_GlobalFoodProduction.csv
- P0_M1_DT02_TopCommoditiesByWeight.csv
- P0_M1_DT03_TopCommoditiesByCalories.csv
- P0_M1_DT04_RegionalProductionPatterns.csv
- P0_M1_DT05_CropAllocationToFeed.csv

2. NUTRIENT DENSITY SOURCES
Nutrient profiles (per 100g edible portion) were extracted from:
- USDA SR Legacy database
- FAO INFOODS composition tables

3. PROCESSING STEPS
- Standardized nutrient values were assigned to top commodities.
- Gross production volume (million tonnes) was converted to total grams.
- Nutrient content per 100g was scaled up to reflect total potential nutrient availability.
- Calculations were performed for energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, and others.
- All figures represent gross biological yield before accounting for waste, loss, or access constraints.

4. LIMITATIONS
- Values are aggregated globally and do not yet reflect bioavailability or distribution inequalities.
- Some micronutrient values were zero or not available for select plant-based commodities.
- Feed allocation and losses were acknowledged but not applied in this round of modeling.
