FINAL OUTCOME REPORT
Title: “Feeding the World Sustainably: Findings from Phases 1–9”
Date: 2025-05-11
Prepared by: Global Plant-Based System Project Technical Team

1. RESEARCH QUESTION
Can the global population be fed a nutritionally complete and ecologically sustainable plant-based diet, within real-world economic, political, and cultural constraints?

2. SYSTEM-LEVEL FINDINGS

A. Evidence of Technical Feasibility
- Nutrition (P1): Diets designed with bioavailability and supplementation meet global needs.
- Agriculture (P2, P3): Cropland freed for rewilding or pulses; GHGs cut by 50–70%.
- Environment (P3): Plant-based transitions align with land use, water, and biodiversity goals.
- Affordability (P4): Costs competitive in many regions if infrastructure is enabled.

Result: Technically feasible at global scale.

B. Constraints and Vulnerabilities Identified
- Equity (P1, P4, P5): Micronutrient and affordability gaps in vulnerable groups.
- Political Trust (P5, P7): High variance in government trust and ideological openness.
- Institutional Capacity (P6, P7): Fragmented capacity to implement pricing, procurement, or education tools.
- Informal Sector (P4): Underestimated role in food access, pricing, and labor.
- Agroecological Limits (P2): Yields constrained in arid/soil-poor AEZs; not uniform across crops.

Result: Feasible only with targeted support and regional flexibility.

3. CROSS-PHASE SYNTHESIS: STRONG VS. WEAK POINTS

Strengths
- Scientific Rigor: Phase 9 remediation ensured uncertainty bounds and Monte Carlo scenario logic.
- Reproducibility: Indexing, metadata, and traceability implemented project-wide.
- Policy Clarity: Stakeholder maps, fiscal overlays, and cultural resistance data allow region-specific planning.

Weaknesses
- Cultural + Political Resistance: Sub-Saharan Africa and MENA remain high-risk for rejection.
- Timeframe Dependency: Transition by 2050 viable only under "Cooperative Acceleration"-style scenarios.
- Economic Exposure: Informal sector transitions require new tools beyond conventional fiscal levers.

4. FINAL OUTCOME
Answer:
Yes, it is possible to feed the global population a nutritionally complete, environmentally sustainable plant-based diet — but only if:
- Institutional, fiscal, and political constraints are explicitly modeled and resolved
- Informal markets and vulnerable demographics are integrated into planning
- Regionally adapted, flexible pathways replace one-size-fits-all global models

5. WHAT NEXT? (Phase 10 and Beyond)
- Phase 10 – Policy Simulation: Model real-world uptake by regime type and stakeholder influence
- Publication: Publish technical synthesis, modules, and summary outputs
- Stakeholder Dialogues: Feed into UN agencies, food councils, and national policy labs
