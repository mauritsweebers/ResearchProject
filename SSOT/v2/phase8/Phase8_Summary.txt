PHASE 8 CONCLUSION

SYNTHESIS FEASIBILITY STATEMENT
-------------------------------
Based on cross-phase synthesis, a global transition to a nutritionally adequate and ecologically viable plant-based food system is technically and environmentally feasible. Success hinges on economic realignment, sociopolitical coordination, and scenario-dependent conditions.

DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CONFIDENCE GRADES
---------------------------------
Nutritional: High Confidence
Agricultural: Moderate Confidence
Environmental: High Confidence
Economic: Moderate Confidence
Cultural-Political: Medium Confidence

SCENARIO OUTCOMES
-----------------
- Cooperative Acceleration: Fully feasible by 2050
- Fragmented Progress: Regionally feasible by 2070
- Lock-in Failure: Unlikely without major reform

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
Model outputs and feasibility assessments are suitable for integration into forward scenario design, risk modeling, and institutional planningâ€”but should not be used for prescriptive policymaking without regional tailoring.
