TX: System Limits and Failure Boundaries â€“ Module 5 Summary

This module outlines major agronomic, environmental, and systemic risks that constrain the scalability of a plant-based food system.

Highlights:
- Climate shocks and water scarcity pose critical limits, particularly in low-latitude regions.
- Soil degradation threatens long-term productivity unless regenerative methods are adopted.
- Pest pressures increase with monoculture systems, emphasizing the need for crop and genetic diversity.
- Economic shocks can disrupt trade-reliant regions without robust supply chains.

Building system resilience requires integrated agroecological, technological, and policy frameworks.
