Module 1 â€“ Cultural Norms and Dietary Identity

This module analyzes the cultural embeddedness of animal-based diets and the role of plant-based foodways across civilizations. It draws on historical anthropological studies, religious dietary laws, and recent behavioral surveys.

Findings:
- High cultural attachment to meat in pastoralist societies and Western industrial contexts.
- Major religious traditions (e.g., Hinduism, Jainism, Seventh-day Adventism) embed plant-based principles.
- Surveys in Europe and Asia suggest moderate willingness to reduce meat if cultural identity is respected.
