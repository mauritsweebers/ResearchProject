Phase 9 Remediation: Phase 2 - Module 1 (Agroecological Yield Overlay)

This optional module addresses QA-flagged concerns about oversimplified yield feasibility assumptions in Phase 2.
It introduces region- and zone-specific yield feasibility estimates for key crops using agroecological zones (AEZs)
as a stratification layer.

Fields include:
- Region
- Crop type (Maize, Soybean, Chickpea)
- AEZ classification (e.g., Semi-Arid, Temperate)
- Feasibility Score (0â€“1)
- Constraint tag (Water, Soil, Temperature, None)

Source basis: FAO/IIASA AEZ typologies, applied heuristically.

Supports scenario realism and transition logic in Phase 2 and Phase 8.

Compliant with Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6 and SCF v1.0 (simulated ðŸŸ¢ classification).
