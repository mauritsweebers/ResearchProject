PHASE 9 — Remediation and Cross-Correction Proposal
Issued: Unified Command
Date: 2025-05-11

------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTIVE
Phase 9 is proposed as a targeted remediation layer to address structural, analytic, and coverage limitations identified in the QA review of Phases 1–8. The goal is to ensure that all synthesized outputs are probabilistically valid, geographically inclusive, demographically disaggregated, and institutionally robust.

------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDIATION THEMES AND TASK GROUPS

1. UNCERTAINTY MODELING AND PARAMETRIC ROBUSTNESS
   - Introduce probability bounds and sensitivity ranges into key datasets:
     • Land use elasticity, crop yields, emissions intensity, cost of production
   - Apply Monte Carlo simulation to scenario components in Phase 8
   - Deliverable: Uncertainty Register + updated data tables in Phase 3, 4, and 8

2. VULNERABILITY AND EQUITY INTEGRATION
   - Add disaggregated variables across gender, income, and rural/urban status in:
     • Phase 1 nutrition assessments
     • Phase 4 labor and affordability metrics
     • Phase 5 cultural and institutional readiness
   - Deliverable: Equity Overlay Dataset + integrated narratives in Phase 8

3. CROSS-PHASE TRACEABILITY AND INDEX LINKAGE
   - Annotate Phase 8 conclusions and scenario text with metadata Index Codes
   - Update metadata schema with `Referenced_By` field
   - Deliverable: Updated Phase8_Conclusion.txt and metadata index file

4. STAKEHOLDER OPPOSITION AND DISSENT MAPPING
   - Construct stakeholder resistance matrix:
     • Actor type × region × form of resistance (economic, ideological, legal)
   - Include peer-reviewed critiques of feasibility claims
   - Deliverable: Phase 7 Supplement Module + resistance figure

5. GEOGRAPHIC AND INFORMAL SECTOR EXTENSION
   - Integrate informal market dynamics into economic feasibility modeling
   - Provide regional sub-scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America
   - Deliverable: Expanded Phase 4 trade tables + regional disaggregates in Phase 8

------------------------------------------------------------
DELIVERY FORMAT
All outputs to conform to Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6 and SSOT Evidence Collection Guide. Phase 9 will be structured modularly, with each remediation action tied to its parent phase.

------------------------------------------------------------
PRIORITIZATION AND RESOURCING
Phase 9 is critical for publication-quality synthesis, policy relevance, and audit defensibility.

Urgent Modules:
- Phase 3, 4, 8: Uncertainty and Scenario Correction
- Phase 1, 4, 5: Vulnerability Integration
- Phase 7: Critique Expansion

Optional Modules (based on bandwidth):
- Phase 2: Agroecological adaptation
- Phase 6: Fiscal realism in transition tools

------------------------------------------------------------
AUTHORIZATION
Phase 9 execution to begin upon confirmation by Project Director. All workstreams to deliver in a coordinated batch under `phase9_validated_package.zip`.
