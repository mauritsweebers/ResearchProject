Phase 9 Remediation: Phase 8 - Module 1 (Scenario Uncertainty Mapping)

This file adds probabilistic interpretation to the Phase 8 scenario logic using:
- P8_M2_DT01_ScenarioMatrix.csv (original matrix)

Method:
- Each qualitative scenario component (substitution level, governance, finance alignment) is assigned a plausibility score
- Feasibility likelihood calculated as composite of inputs
- Confidence level subjectively assessed per scenario

Deliverable: P9_M1_Uncertainty_ScenarioMapping.csv

Supports Monte Carlo integration in Phase 8 synthesis models.

Compliant with Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6 and SCF v1.0 (ðŸŸ¢ source Phase 8).
