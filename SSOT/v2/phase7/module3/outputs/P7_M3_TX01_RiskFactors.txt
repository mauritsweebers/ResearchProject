Module 3 â€“ External Risks and Shocks

This module evaluates exogenous risks that could compromise or reverse the transition to plant-based food systems, including trade shocks, climate events, and systemic lock-ins.

Findings:
- Climate shocks (e.g., multiyear droughts, pest outbreaks) could destabilize monoculture-dependent regions.
- Trade chokepoints (e.g., Suez, Panama) remain critical for staple flows in high-transition scenarios.
- Path dependency from food infrastructure investment may lock in suboptimal dietary or processing patterns.
