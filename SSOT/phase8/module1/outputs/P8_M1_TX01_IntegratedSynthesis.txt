Module 1 â€“ Integrated Findings Synthesis

This synthesis module aggregates evidence from Phases 1â€“7 to assess the feasibility of a global shift to a nutritionally adequate, ecologically viable plant-based food system across five domains:

- Nutritional: Verified by Phase 1 (P1.M1.TX01, P1.M2.DT01); complete nutrient profiles are achievable with sufficient diversity and fortification.
- Agricultural: Phase 2 (P2_M1_DT01_CropAllocation_CORRECTED.csv) confirms adequate global nutrient yields per hectare under plant-only regimes, albeit with regional yield gaps.
- Environmental: Phase 3 (P3.M2.FG01, P3.M1.TX01) projects up to 70% GHG reduction and 3B ha land savings.
- Economic: Phase 4 (P4.M1.TX01, P4.M2.DT01) confirms viability with caveats for regional infrastructure gaps.
- Socio-political: Phase 5 (P5.M2.TX01, P5.M4.DT01) indicates conditional acceptability, contingent on cultural alignment and institutional support.

Each domain has been assigned a confidence level based on evidence strength and scope.
