Module 2 â€“ Scenario Modeling and Framing

This module constructs structured scenarios for plant-based transition feasibility based on key variable combinations from Phases 1â€“7. Scenarios include:

1. "Cooperative Acceleration": High substitution, strong multilateral governance, targeted transition finance
2. "Fragmented Progress": Moderate substitution, uneven adoption, low global coordination
3. "Lock-in Failure": Low substitution, infrastructure inertia, policy resistance

Each scenario outlines constraints and enablers across ecological, economic, and political dimensions.
