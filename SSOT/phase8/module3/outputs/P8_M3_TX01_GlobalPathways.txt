Module 3 – Transition Pathways and Global Feasibility Assessment

This module maps regionally differentiated pathways for transitioning to plant-based systems, leveraging leverage points and bottlenecks identified in Phases 2–6.

Findings:
- High-income regions can transition faster via procurement and policy shifts (P6.M1.TX01, P4.M2.DT01).
- Middle-income regions require blended strategies: investment, cultural adaptation, and supply chain reconfiguration.
- Low-income regions face major capacity gaps and need sustained external financing and education infrastructure.

Timeline modeling for 2030, 2050, 2100 estimates earliest feasible global completion around 2050–2070 under “cooperative acceleration.”
