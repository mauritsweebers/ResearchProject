PHASE 8 CONCLUSION – Total Feasibility Verdict and Forward Linkage

Final Verdict:
A global transition to nutritionally adequate, agroecologically feasible, environmentally superior, and economically viable plant-based dietary systems is achievable with high confidence under structured, multi-vector reform.

Caveats:
- Political and institutional fragility remain the strongest barriers.
- Cultural and price acceptance vary, requiring regionally adapted strategies.
- Equity-first frameworks are most robust across scenarios and should anchor final policy layers in Phase 10.

Forward Linkages:
- Results feed directly into Phase 9 for temporal disruption modeling and resilience testing.
- Final outcome surfaces inform Phase 10 roadmap construction and publication.

System Grade:
B+ (Globally Weighted Average) – Feasible, with material risks and known solutions
