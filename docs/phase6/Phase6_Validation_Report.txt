PHASE 6 VALIDATION REPORT â€“ Implementation Strategy QA and Integration Readiness

Prepared: Phase Command
Reference: Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6

QA Summary:
- âœ… All listed deliverables in Phase6_Metadata.csv are present and structurally compliant.
- âœ… QA log confirms 100% coverage and index traceability.
- âœ… SCF classification used: All sources are ðŸŸ¢ A (policy/institutional) or ðŸŸ¡ B (peer-reviewed or traceable civic sources).

Module Integrity:
- M1â€“M4 modules align with required scope: policy, finance, institutions, and civil society.
- Text summaries integrate known implementation mechanisms, barrier typologies, and case study validations.
- Data tables confirm leverage zones, activation levels, and reform viability patterns.

Cross-Phase Integration:
- Outputs validated for use in:
  â€¢ Phase 8 scoring models (transition feasibility index)
  â€¢ Phase 10 implementation simulation
  â€¢ Policy window detection in Phase 9 temporal models

Assumptions:
- Implementation likelihood modeled deterministically; no stochastic disruption modeling included in Phase 6.
- Activator dependencies assumed to be independent â€” interaction modeling deferred to Phase 8 or 10.

Conclusion:
Phase 6 meets all structural, evidentiary, and integration criteria. Results are now operational within downstream phases.

[Validation Extension â€“ v1.1]
Confirmed: Phase 6 modules (Policy, Financial, Institutional, Civil Society) are not sensitive to nutrient yield assumptions from P2_M1. Phase remains valid under corrected assumptions.
