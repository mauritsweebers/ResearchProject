Phase 9 Remediation: Phase 3 - Module 2 (Land Sparing and Carbon Sequestration)

This document introduces uncertainty parameters for global carbon sequestration potential through land sparing.
The primary estimate (300 GtCOâ‚‚ over 100 years) has been bounded using a triangular distribution with limits based on biome variability
and rewilding intensity scenarios.
