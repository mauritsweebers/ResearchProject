PHASE 9 â€“ Remediation and Cross-Phase Correction
Protocol: HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6
Date Finalized: 2025-05-11
Modules: 7 | Deliverables: 14

Objective:
Phase 9 executed targeted corrections to address analytic gaps, population equity deficits, uncertainty propagation, stakeholder resistance, and metadata traceability across Phases 1â€“8. Remediation ensured protocol alignment, reproducibility, and scenario defensibility.

Scope & Method:
Seven modules were constructed across six originating phases. Each delivered structured outputs in CSV (DT) and TXT (TX) formats. Data were derived exclusively from SCF-verified (ðŸŸ¢) sources. Monte Carlo estimates, equity overlays, resistance matrices, and categorical uncertainty mappings were created. Metadata was rebuilt with full index linkage and thematic tags.

Key Findings:
- Phase 1: Vulnerability disaggregation by nutrient adequacy shows demographic risk clustering.
- Phase 3: GHGs, land, and tradeoff metrics were upgraded with uncertainty bounds and distributions.
- Phase 4: Labor and affordability burdens disaggregated by commodity and infrastructure.
- Phase 5: Cultural and institutional resistance modeled via openness and trust indices.
- Phase 7: Stakeholder resistance classified by actor type and opposition form.
- Phase 8: Scenario feasibility assigned quantitative likelihoods and confidence tiers.
- All outputs indexed with SCF category (ðŸŸ¢), parent codes, and module ID.

Implications:
This phase enables publication-ready synthesis with built-in variance bounds, equity diagnostics, and stakeholder realism. It closes all Phase 8 QA flags and ensures audit trail continuity for Phase 10 integration and external review.
