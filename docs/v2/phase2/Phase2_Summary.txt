PHASE 2 â€“ Agricultural Feasibility of Nutrient-Sufficient Plant-Based Diets
Protocol: HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6

Modules: 5 | Deliverables: 15

Objective:
To determine whether global agriculture can produce the crop types and volumes necessary to meet human nutrient requirements exclusively through plant-based foods, given regional land, climate, water, and ecological constraints.

Scope & Method:
Phase 2 assesses feasibility across five modules: evaluating nutrient-per-hectare crop yields (Module 1), climate-specific yield feasibility (Module 2), environmental trade-offs including land, water, and emissions (Module 3), regional productivity variation (Module 4), and system constraints under stress scenarios (Module 5). All datasets draw from peer-reviewed agronomic models, FAO statistics, and environmental impact meta-analyses.

Key Findings:
- High-efficiency protein and micronutrient crops (e.g., soy, lentils, kale) can meet human needs on less land than current systems require.
- Yield feasibility varies sharply by climate zone, with temperate and subtropical regions offering the best performance.
- Environmental trade-offs highlight the importance of integrating cereals with legumes to balance water use, emissions, and nutrient supply.
- Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia exhibit large cropland areas but low productivity, requiring systemic support to close yield gaps.
- Systemic risks (e.g., climate shocks, pest outbreaks, soil degradation) impose limits that necessitate diversification, agroecological resilience, and infrastructure investment.

Implications:
A global shift to plant-based agriculture is feasible under biophysical conditions but highly uneven across regions. Targeted investments in agroecological practices, yield-gap closure, and adaptive cropping systems are essential for maintaining nutritional adequacy at scale. These findings inform Phase 3, which will quantify the environmental outcomes of such a transition.
