Module 4 â€“ Cross-Disciplinary Critique and Dissent

This module documents structured dissent from academic and stakeholder sources, focusing on critiques from political ecology, anthropology, rural studies, and economic modeling.

Findings:
- Anthropologists argue that top-down dietary shifts often ignore food sovereignty and cultural resilience.
- Political ecology critiques warn of "green colonialism" if global models override local priorities.
- Rural economic studies suggest high transitional risk for livestock-dependent communities without compensation guarantees.

Sources: Rural Sociology (2022), Journal of Peasant Studies (2023), stakeholder analyses (ðŸŸ¡).
