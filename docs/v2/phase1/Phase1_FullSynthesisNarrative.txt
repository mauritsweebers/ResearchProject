Phase 1 – Nutritional Viability Synthesis Narrative
(Compiled from QA-verified TX files across Modules 3–7)

Objective:
Phase 1 establishes whether a global food system based entirely on plant-based foods can meet human nutrient requirements across population groups when adjusted for bioavailability, dietary interactions, and physiological constraints. This synthesis integrates structured outputs from Modules 3 to 7, culminating in a boundary-case stress test.

M3: Bioavailability Adjustment Modeling
Gross nutrient availability alone is insufficient to evaluate dietary adequacy. In Module 3, we modeled physiological bioavailability using nutrient-specific absorption coefficients sourced from WHO/FAO, NIH, EFSA, and peer-reviewed meta-analyses.
- Absorbable fractions were applied to energy, protein, calcium, iron, zinc, B12, folate, vitamins A and D.
- The modeling assumes mixed diets, with limitations including lack of demographic specificity and no accounting for inhibitors/enhancers at the meal level.

M4: Demographic Adequacy Modeling
Using the bioavailability-adjusted nutrient supply from M3, we compared daily per capita intake to globally harmonized nutrient requirements stratified by age, sex, and reproductive status.
- The adequacy ratio (supply ÷ requirement) was calculated per demographic group.
- Output flagged consistent adequacy shortfalls for iron, B12, vitamin D, and calcium, particularly in groups with elevated physiological needs (e.g., adolescents, pregnant/lactating women).

M5: Nutrient Synergies and Inhibitors
We incorporated meal-level nutrient interaction logic:
- Enhancers (e.g., vitamin C boosting iron absorption, prebiotics aiding calcium uptake)
- Inhibitors (e.g., phytates, oxalates, fiber–mineral complexes)

Effect sizes and mechanism-based modifiers were drawn from WHO/FAO and peer-reviewed nutrient absorption literature. These were integrated into a nutrient interaction matrix, refining the effective absorption modeled in M3 and M4. Synergistic effects were limited in strength relative to inhibitors in most plant-based diets.

M6: Micronutrient Risk Classification
Adequacy ratios were translated into risk classes based on WHO/FAO thresholds:
- < 0.6 → high risk
- < 0.9 → moderate
- < 1.0 → marginal
- ≥ 1.0 → adequate

Findings confirmed widespread high-to-moderate risk zones for:
- Vitamin B12 (absent from unfortified plant sources)
- Iron and Zinc (limited by phytates and matrix inhibition)
- Vitamin D and Calcium (under-supplied without fortified foods or supplements)

M7: Boundary Case Testing
Stress testing scenarios were developed to simulate worst-case diets:
- Cereal-dominant, unfortified
- High-fiber/low-diversity diets
- Populations with high nutrient demands

All six boundary diets tested resulted in multiple nutrient failures, confirming that unfortified, unvaried plant-based diets are insufficient for specific populations without strategic interventions.

Summary & Implications:
1. Bioavailable adequacy of a plant-based system is achievable for many nutrients—but not universally.
2. Shortfall nutrients include: Vitamin B12, Iron, Zinc, Calcium, Vitamin D.
3. Population groups most at risk: children, adolescents, pregnant/lactating women.
4. Modulating factors such as fortification, supplementation, and dietary diversity are essential enablers.
5. Scenarios without such interventions consistently fail at meeting basic nutritional thresholds.
