Module 3 â€“ Regulatory and Legal Constraints

This module surveys national policies, food labeling regulations, and legal frameworks that influence the viability of plant-based food systems. Focus is placed on subsidy structures, trade classification, and food sovereignty debates.

Findings:
- Over 60 countries subsidize animal agriculture more heavily than plant production.
- Legal naming restrictions on plant-based products exist in the EU, USA, and Brazil.
- Trade classifications under WTO rules create inconsistencies in tariff treatment.
