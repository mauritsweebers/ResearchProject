Module 1 â€“ Policy Instruments and Governance Tools

This module reviews documented policy instruments used to influence dietary systems toward sustainability. Focus areas include subsidy reform, carbon-linked food taxes, procurement rules, and policy diffusion mechanisms.

Findings:
- Several countries (e.g., Denmark, Germany) have trialed or proposed carbon-based food pricing with varied political reception.
- Public procurement standards (e.g., school meals, hospitals) have successfully introduced plant-forward norms in Brazil, Sweden, and South Korea.
- Legal precedents on food labeling and zoning (e.g., meat-free city zones) are emerging but remain niche.
