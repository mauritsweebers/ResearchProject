PHASE 4 – Economic & Supply Chain Viability
Protocol: HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6
Date Finalized: 2025-05-11
Modules: 4 | Deliverables: 8

Objective:
To evaluate the economic and logistical feasibility of a global transition to a nutritionally adequate, plant-based food system. This includes examining cost structures, infrastructure readiness, supply chain dependencies, and transition investment requirements.

Scope & Method:
Phase 4 includes four modules: comparative production costs and elasticity across plant and animal food categories (Module 1), labor and infrastructure readiness by region (Module 2), global trade dependencies and processing chokepoints (Module 3), and investment scenarios for food system transitions (Module 4). Evidence is drawn from FAOStat, OECD, WFP, IMF, and national economic reports. Deliverables include synthesis texts (TX), data tables (DT), and metadata registers.

Key Findings:
- Cost Efficiency: Cereal, legume, and tuber production is significantly less expensive per kilocalorie than animal products. Subsidies continue to distort market costs.
- Labor Input: Plant-based food systems require less labor per kcal but need expanded post-harvest and processing infrastructure in the Global South.
- Trade Chokepoints: High reliance on a few regions for processing (e.g., East Asia, Northern Europe) introduces risk. Critical corridors (e.g., Suez, Panama) pose vulnerability.
- Transition Investment: Transitioning selected countries (e.g., Brazil, India) would require $150–$600 per capita. Public finance currently undercovers required investment.

Implications:
Phase 4 confirms that a plant-based food system is economically viable under current conditions but will require targeted infrastructure investment, supply chain resilience planning, and financial support mechanisms to address regional disparities. These findings provide an empirical foundation for political and cultural feasibility assessment in Phase 5.
