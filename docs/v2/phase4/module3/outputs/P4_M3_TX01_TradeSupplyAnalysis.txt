Module 3 â€“ Trade & Supply Chain Dependencies

This module maps global trade flows for key plant-based staples, intermediary processing requirements, and vulnerability points. Analysis is grounded in COMTRADE and FAOSTAT data, supported by WFP logistics maps.

Findings:
- Soy, wheat, and maize dominate plant-based export flows.
- Processing chokepoints are regionally concentrated in East Asia and Northern Europe.
- Supply chains are vulnerable to transport corridor disruptions (e.g., Suez, Panama).
