------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE OBJECTIVE
To implement targeted remediation tasks arising from QA findings across Phases 1â€“8. The aim is to strengthen uncertainty handling, equity integration, stakeholder realism, geographic inclusivity, and metadata traceability.

------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE OF OUTPUT
Permitted outputs:
- Updated data tables (.csv) with uncertainty bands, equity flags, or region splits
- Supplementary text files (.txt) documenting critique, linkage, or method upgrades
- Scenario adjustments or annotated synthesis files (.txt, .csv, .svg)

All sources must be ðŸŸ¢ or ðŸŸ¡ per SCF v1.0.

------------------------------------------------------------
DELIVERY FORMAT
Each module must deliver:
- /data/*.csv for quantitative corrections or additions
- /outputs/*.txt for documented interpretation upgrades or new commentary
- /outputs/*.svg|.png for visual matrix extensions (optional)

Metadata requirements:
- Indexed in Phase9_Metadata.csv
- Stored in /ssot/phase9/moduleX/ in correct subfolders
- Cross-referenced by parent Phase and Index Code origin (if applicable)

------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLIANCE
All remediation work must follow:
- Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6
- SSOT Evidence Guide

- Required components:
  â€¢ Phase9_Metadata.csv
  â€¢ Phase9_Summary.txt
  â€¢ Phase9_QA_Log.csv
