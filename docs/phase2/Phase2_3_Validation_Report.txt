Phase 2 & 3 Validation Report â€“ QA and Research Quality

Prepared by: Director
Protocol Reference: Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 QA FINDINGS
------------------------------------------------------------

- All files listed in Phase2_Metadata.csv were found in the correct locations.
- Directory and file structure follow SSOT and UCP conventions.
- Metadata entries are correctly indexed and use valid SCF categories (ðŸŸ¢ or ðŸŸ¡).
- Phase2_Summary.txt is present and correctly formatted.
- Phase2_QA_Log.csv confirms full file integrity.

Research Quality Review:
- TX summaries present regionally structured, crop-specific yield analysis.
- Language is technically sound and quantitatively framed.
- Metadata is complete but would benefit from more precise data citations.

Areas for Improvement:
1. Source Traceability in Phase 2 Outputs:
   Findings are plausible but require explicit data source attribution (e.g., FAOSTAT, GAEZ).

2. Structural Consistency in TX Summaries:
   TX documents should include scope, method, source references, findings, and limitations in a standard order.

3. Figure Labeling and Attribution Standards:
   P2_M1_FG01_ProteinYieldBarChart.png needs visual QA: axes, legend, source labeling.

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3 QA FINDINGS
------------------------------------------------------------

- All Phase3_Metadata.csv entries matched actual files.
- Correct use of module subfolders and naming conventions.
- TX outputs provide quantified environmental impacts with clear references to primary sources.
- Summary and QA log present and structurally valid.

Research Quality Review:
- Phase 3 uses high-confidence sources (Poore & Nemecek, Clark et al., IPBES).
- Synthesis is comparative, metric-based, and policy-relevant.
- All outputs meet SCF v1.0 evidentiary standards.
