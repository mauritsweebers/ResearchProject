TX: Crop Allocation Strategies – Module 1 Summary

This module evaluates land use efficiency and nutrient density across candidate crops suitable for a global plant-based diet.
Key findings include:

1. Legumes like soybeans, lentils, and chickpeas offer the highest protein yield per hectare, ranging from 2200–2800 kg/ha.
2. Dark leafy greens such as kale and broccoli are calcium-dense but have lower calorie yields and higher land use per kilocalorie.
3. Root crops like sweet potatoes provide land-efficient calories but lower protein and iron.
4. Crops such as oats, wheat, and maize balance calorie and nutrient yield with relatively low land demand.

These findings support crop allocation models that optimize both nutrient coverage and ecological efficiency.
