PHASE 3 – Environmental Impacts of Global Plant-Based Dietary Scenarios (Final)

Date Finalized: 2025-05-28
Modules: 3 | Deliverables: 7

Objective:
To quantify and map the environmental consequences of transitioning to plant-based dietary systems, including effects on land use, GHG emissions, and biodiversity across regional and agroecological zones.

Scope & Method:
Phase 3 integrates GHG emission data, land use overlays, and biodiversity impact models across three modules. Data are based on FAOSTAT, IPCC AR6 dietary factors, GAEZ yield zones, and BII projections. Outputs cover dietary variants and simulate scenario flexibility (waste, yield, substitution).

Key Findings:
- Global GHG emissions decline by ~40% in full plant-based transitions, with regional reductions highest in Latin America and North America.
- Land requirements drop 35–45% depending on substitution rates and waste reduction.
- Biodiversity pressure decreases across AEZs, with notable gains in tropical and temperate zones via land sparing.
- Variant scenarios confirm feasibility under both conservative (low yield, high waste) and optimized (high yield, low waste) assumptions.

Conclusion:
Plant-based dietary transitions deliver significant environmental co-benefits across all metrics modeled. AEZ overlays support targeted regional adaptation, and Phase 3 metrics now feed directly into Phase 6 (transition logic) and Phase 8 (scenario synthesis).Uncertainty Scope Note:  
Phase 3 delivers deterministic baseline estimates for GHG emissions, land use, and biodiversity pressure under modeled dietary transitions. Quantitative uncertainty and sensitivity analysis (e.g., Monte Carlo modeling) is handled in Phase 9 and applied retroactively to Phase 3 outputs during Phase 8 scenario integration. No probabilistic models are implemented directly in this phase.
