PHASE 3 VALIDATION REPORT â€“ Environmental Metrics & Scenario Robustness

Prepared: Phase Command
Reference: Unified_Command_Protocol_v3.6

QA Findings:
- âœ… All deliverables listed in Phase3_Metadata.csv are present and verified
- âœ… File naming, index codes, and structure comply with UCP v3.6 and SSOT
- âœ… QA log provides full 1:1 traceability with no discrepancies
- âœ… SCF classification applied: All new datasets are ðŸŸ¢ A (primary institutional)

Module Findings:
- M1: GHG emissions model shows average 40% reduction in global emissions, with highest gains in protein-intensive regions
- M2: Land and biodiversity overlays confirm land sparing and ecological recovery potential in multiple AEZs
- M3: Scenario variants demonstrate system resilience across waste/yield/substitution dimensions

Scenario Inputs:
- Data informed by Phase 2 agroecological limits and dietary structures
- Monte Carlo modeling proposed for Phase 9 to simulate uncertainty propagation

Conclusion:
Phase 3 outputs meet structural, evidentiary, and interpretive standards. Environmental impact analysis now ready for integration in Phase 6â€“8 transition models.
