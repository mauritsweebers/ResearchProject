## 1. Global Trade Architecture

- Food systems are deeply integrated into global trade flows.
- A small number of commodities (e.g. wheat, soy, maize, beef) dominate cross-border flows by volume and value.
- Major exporters (Brazil, US, EU, Russia) often dominate specific markets, while importers (e.g., China, Egypt, Bangladesh) show high commodity-specific dependency.

## 2. Agricultural Subsidy Structures

- OECD countries allocate significant public funds to agricultural support: ~$90B in EU (CAP), ~$53B in US, mostly through income support, insurance, and market stabilization.
- BRICS nations‚Äîespecially China and India‚Äîprovide substantial support via price guarantees and input subsidies, often focusing on food security crops (rice, wheat, pulses).

## 3. Market Concentration

- The food system exhibits **high horizontal and vertical integration**:
  - **Inputs**: Top 4 agrochemical firms control >60% of global sales.
  - **Grain Trading**: Four firms (ADM, Bunge, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus‚Äî‚ÄúABCD‚Äù) handle ~70‚Äì90% of global grain trade.
  - **Retail**: Concentrated in high-income countries (e.g., Walmart, Costco dominate US grocery sector).
  - **Processing**: Meat and dairy processors are globally consolidated (e.g., JBS, Tyson).

## 4. Global vs. Regional Dependencies

- Many low-income countries are net food importers with high exposure to global market volatility.
- However, regional trading blocs (e.g., EU, ASEAN, Mercosur) mitigate some reliance via intra-regional exchange.
- Critical supply chain interdependencies exist in fertilizers, feed, and oilseeds‚Äîespecially between South America, the Black Sea region, and East Asia.

## 5. Structural Vulnerabilities

- Price shocks, export restrictions, or logistical disruptions (e.g. COVID-19, Ukraine war) can ripple quickly due to system centralization.
- Emerging policy focus areas include shortening supply chains, enhancing domestic processing, and diversifying trade partners.

This economic structure baseline informs later phases analyzing resilience, equity, and transition pathways within global food systems.
