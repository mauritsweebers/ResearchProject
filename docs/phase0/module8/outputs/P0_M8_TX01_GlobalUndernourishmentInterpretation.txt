Title: Global Caloric and Protein Undernourishment Interpretation

This analysis quantifies the extent of undernourishment in the current global food system,
specifically in relation to caloric and protein sufficiency. Estimates are drawn from
FAOâ€™s State of Food Insecurity (SOFI), the World Bank, GBD 2020, and UNICEF nutritional
monitoring datasets.

Key Findings:
- Approximately 11% of the global population is calorically undernourished.
- Protein inadequacy affects 9% globally, despite high production volumes.
- The highest burden of caloric undernourishment is observed in Sub-Saharan Africa (~22%),
  followed by parts of South and Southeast Asia.
- Protein gaps are most acute where diets are cereal-dominated and animal product access is limited.

Implications:
- The existing animal-inclusive food system is failing to provide sufficient caloric and protein
  coverage to vulnerable populations.
- This baseline highlights the urgent need for system reform, equitable access to nutrient-dense
  foods, and efficiency improvements in food allocation.
