Title: Global Micronutrient Deficiency Baseline Interpretation

This summary establishes the empirical foundation for understanding nutrient inadequacy 
under the current, animal-inclusive global food system. Data are synthesized from WHO, 
UNICEF, FAO, and Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies.

Key Findings:
- Vitamin B12 deficiency affects over 47% of the global population, especially in South Asia and Africa.
- Iron and vitamin A deficiencies are concentrated in Africa, Asia, and parts of Latin America, affecting children and women disproportionately.
- Zinc and folate deficiencies correlate strongly with low dietary diversity and low intake of legumes, nuts, and leafy vegetables.
- Iodine deficiency remains persistent in regions without universal salt iodization.
- Omega-3 inadequacies are widespread, even in high-income regions, due to low fish intake and poor conversion from ALA sources.

Implications:
- Current food systems are failing to deliver micronutrient sufficiency despite high animal-based food intake in many regions.
- This baseline demonstrates the urgent need for dietary system reform, nutrient-dense crop promotion, and biofortification or supplementation programs.
