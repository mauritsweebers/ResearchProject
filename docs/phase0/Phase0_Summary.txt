PHASE 0 – Global Food System Baseline Assessment (Revised)

Date Finalized: 2025-05-28
Modules: 6 (+ Extended Audit) | Deliverables: 22

Objective:
To establish a comprehensive, disaggregated, and empirically validated baseline of the global food system in its current, animal-inclusive configuration. This includes documenting structural inefficiencies, ecological costs, nutritional gaps, and trade dependencies—forming the empirical foundation for scenario-based transitions in later phases.

Scope & Method:
Phase 0 integrates data from FAO, IPCC, UNEP, OECD, WTO, and peer-reviewed sources. Modules cover land and resource use, food production, trade flows, environmental impacts, dietary patterns, and cultural-political structures. The re-execution introduces extended granularity in feed-to-food conversion ratios, export reliance, and income-based food waste differentials. Data harmonization was standardized using 2020 reference population and global FAOSTAT food balance sheets. Source validation used SCF_v1.0 protocols.

Key Findings:
- Animal-sourced foods contribute over 75% of food-related agricultural emissions, with low feed efficiency.
- Nearly 2.4 billion people are nutrient-insecure despite global protein oversupply.
- High-income regions exhibit disproportionate food waste, especially in meat and dairy sectors.
- Over half of Africa’s cereal and protein commodity supply depends on imports.
- Feed crops dominate arable land use but serve indirect nutritional functions.
- The global food system is regionally uneven, structurally concentrated, and socio-politically resistant to change.

Implications:
This revised baseline defines the counterfactual model for transition assessments. It provides a unified structure for modeling ecological, economic, and nutritional impacts of food system reforms. All PhaseX modules must align with this SSOT-compliant reference.
