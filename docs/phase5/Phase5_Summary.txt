PHASE 5 – Political, Cultural, and Institutional Constraints on Plant-Based Reform (Final)

Date Finalized: 2025-05-28
Modules: 4 | Deliverables: 8

Objective:
To identify and quantify sociopolitical barriers that may obstruct dietary transition efforts. Phase 5 evaluates cultural resistance, political risks, institutional capacity, and compound vulnerabilities across global regions.

Scope & Method:
Data were collected from institutional trust indices, cultural dietary surveys, government effectiveness ratings, and public policy benchmarks. Each module contributes to a composite risk score used to stratify implementation difficulty across countries and regions.

Key Findings:
- M1: Cultural resistance is highest in regions with strong religious dietary norms, food-linked national identity, and anti-globalization narratives.
- M2: Political resistance correlates with low state capacity, polarization, and poor trust in government; food system lobbies intensify exposure.
- M3: Institutional capability varies dramatically—Nordic and some East Asian states score high; South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa remain fragile.
- M4: Composite overlays show highest vulnerability in LMICs with intersecting cultural, political, and administrative weaknesses.

Scoring Logic:
- Composite score = (Cultural × 0.3) + (Political × 0.3) + (Institutional × 0.4)
- Regional scores normalized 0–100; >70 = High Resistance Zone
- Country-level maps and overlays available via Phase 6 input layer

Conclusion:
Sociopolitical feasibility of plant-based transition varies widely. Institutional reform, political framing, and cultural adaptation strategies are essential for long-term success. Outputs from Phase 5 directly inform Phase 6 policy realism and Phase 8 scenario modeling.
