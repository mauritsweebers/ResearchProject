P1_M2_TX02 – Crop Breeding for Protein Quality

Several agronomic and biotechnological approaches are used to enhance the amino acid profiles of staple crops:

- High-lysine maize (opaque-2) has been bred to improve lysine content by 50–100%.
- Quality Protein Maize (QPM) varieties have improved digestibility and balance of essential amino acids.
- Genetic engineering has enabled soybeans and potatoes with boosted methionine content.
- Conventional breeding of legumes (e.g., common beans) has targeted sulfur amino acid concentrations.

These innovations enable plant-based diets to meet protein quality targets more effectively, particularly in populations relying heavily on a limited number of staple crops.
