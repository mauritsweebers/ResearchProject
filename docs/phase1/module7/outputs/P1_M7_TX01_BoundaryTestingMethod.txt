This file outlines the approach used in Phase 1 â€“ Module 7 to identify and test nutritional boundary cases under global plant-based dietary assumptions.

1. OBJECTIVE
To define dietary and demographic edge cases where plant-based systems are most likely to fail to meet physiological nutrient adequacy, even after accounting for bioavailability and interaction effects.

2. SOURCE DATA
- Nutrient adequacy ratios: P1_M4_DT01_NutrientAdequacyByGroup.csv
- Risk classifications: P1_M6_DT01_MicronutrientRiskByGroup.csv
- Nutrient interaction modifiers: P1_M5_DT01_SynergyInhibitionMatrix.csv
- Global requirement benchmarks: WHO/FAO/UNICEF/GBD

3. SCENARIO STRUCTURE
Each case is defined by:
- Demographic group (e.g., adolescent female, infant)
- Diet structure (e.g., cereal-legume base, low diversity, absence of fortification)
- Key interaction or absorption modifiers
- Expected limiting nutrients and projected escalation in deficiency risk

4. LIMITATIONS
- Scenarios are theoretical boundary conditions, not observed diets
- Does not model cultural, economic, or behavioral compliance
- Interaction effects are approximated as directional modifiers without full meal-level simulation
