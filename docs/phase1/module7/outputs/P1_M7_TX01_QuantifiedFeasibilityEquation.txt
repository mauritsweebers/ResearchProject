Title: Quantified Feasibility Equation for Nutritional Adequacy of Plant-Based Diets

This model quantifies how structured plant-based diets, enhanced through targeted fortification 
and supplementation, can meet or exceed 100% of the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) across all 
essential nutrients for all key demographic groups.

Equation:
N_total = Î£ [ (Q_i Ã— N_i Ã— B_i) + F_i + S_i ]

Where:
- Q_i = Quantity of food item i consumed per day (grams)
- N_i = Nutrient content per 100g of item i
- B_i = Bioavailability adjustment factor for item i (0â€“1 scale)
- F_i = Fortification input (added nutrient quantity from fortified food)
- S_i = Supplementation input (added nutrient quantity from direct supplementation)

Demographic Groups Modeled:
- Children
- Adults
- Pregnant Women
- Elderly

Nutrients Covered:
- Energy, Protein, Iron, Calcium, Zinc, Vitamin B12, Omega-3, and others

RDI is deemed met when:
Î£ [ (Q_i Ã— N_i Ã— B_i) + F_i + S_i ] â‰¥ RDI_d for each demographic group d

Conclusion:
This model provides the empirical basis for Phase 1's viability claim. It will serve as the 
quantitative foundation for system-wide feasibility projections in Phase 8.
