PHASE 1 – Nutritional Viability Assessment (Final)

Date Finalized: 2025-05-28
Modules: 7 | Deliverables: 26

Objective:
To assess whether a plant-based dietary system can meet the nutritional needs of all global population groups.
Phase 1 evaluates bioavailability-adjusted nutrient supply and introduces a quantified model demonstrating feasibility.

Scope & Method:
Data were integrated from WHO, FAO, USDA, and EFSA on dietary reference intakes, food composition, and nutrient bioavailability.
Phase 1 uses modeling across key population demographics (children, adults, pregnant, elderly) and includes adjustments for
absorption, fortification, and supplementation.

Key Findings:
- Macronutrient needs are covered by diversified plant-based diets.
- Gaps exist in B12, DHA, iron, and calcium for specific groups.
- Module 7 shows that these gaps can be closed quantitatively using validated interventions.

Module 7 Integration:
- Provides a formal equation linking food intake, bioavailability, and intervention
- Demonstrates full RDI coverage for four demographic groups
- Supports transition viability modeling in Phases 6–8

Conclusion:
Phase 1 confirms the nutritional viability of a plant-based system conditional upon evidence-based fortification and dietary
design strategies. Outputs form a required evidence base for scenario modeling and equity testing.

As of 2025-05-28, Module 2 was formally expanded by Command to include deliverables on protein quality. These outputs clarify plant-based protein limitations and the conditions under which adequacy is feasible, using metrics such as DIAAS and amino acid complementarity. This supports robust modeling in downstream phases.
