PHASE 8 – Feasibility Synthesis, Scenario Modeling, and Outcome Grading (Final)

Date Finalized: 2025-05-28
Modules: 3 | Deliverables: 6

Objective:
To synthesize findings from Phases 0–7 into a unified feasibility model for global plant-based dietary transition. Phase 8 integrates outcome grades, scenario matrices, and transition timelines to evaluate total system readiness.

Scope & Method:
Phase 8 assesses transition feasibility across nutrition, agriculture, environment, economics, politics, and implementation. Inputs from prior phases are weighted and scored using deterministic models. Outputs include regional feasibility grades (A–F), scenario variants, and estimated timelines for full implementation by constraint category.

Key Findings:
- 26% of global population regions receive grade A or B under baseline transition scenario; 61% score C or higher
- High-risk zones (grades D–F) cluster around weak institutional capacity, high cultural resistance, or low income elasticity
- Scenario variants reveal that “equity-first” transitions outperform “policy-only” and “technology-only” in long-term stability
- Estimated implementation timelines range from 6 years (Nordics, Oceania) to 25+ years (South Asia, parts of Africa)

Conclusion:
Global transition to plant-based dietary systems is structurally and empirically feasible under coordinated multi-sectoral reform. Timelines and pathways vary, but cumulative barriers are addressable with targeted strategies.

Updated Module 1 synthesis to reflect corrected crop-level nutrient yields from Phase 2. Ensured agricultural feasibility judgment aligns with P2_M1_DT01_CropAllocation_CORRECTED.csv.
