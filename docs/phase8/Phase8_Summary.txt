PHASE 8 – Synthesis and Scenario Modeling
Protocol: HTML_Output_Protocol_v1.6
Date Finalized: 2025-05-11
Modules: 3 | Deliverables: 6

Objective:
To synthesize evidence from Phases 1–7 and generate structured conclusions and modeled scenarios on the global feasibility of a nutritionally adequate, plant-based food system.

Scope & Method:
Phase 8 integrates all previous findings through three modules: a domain-level synthesis matrix (Module 1), scenario modeling across governance and substitution dimensions (Module 2), and regionally differentiated transition pathways (Module 3). Models were constructed only from QA-validated Phase outputs with confidence assessments.

Key Findings:
- Feasibility is high for nutritional and environmental goals, moderate for economic and sociopolitical factors.
- Scenarios show outcomes range from full feasibility under strong governance to failure under infrastructure lock-in.
- Regional disparities are central: early transition likely in high-income regions; delayed feasibility in low-capacity contexts.

Implications:
The transition to a plant-based global food system is conditionally feasible with high ecological and nutritional confidence. Political coordination, financial commitment, and cultural adaptation are primary constraints. These results finalize the analytic pipeline and support decision frameworks and stakeholder modeling.
