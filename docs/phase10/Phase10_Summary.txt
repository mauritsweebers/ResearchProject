PHASE 10 â€“ Global Transition Architecture and Policy Synthesis (Final)

Date Finalized: 2025-05-28
Modules: 5 | Deliverables: 8

Objective:
To translate cumulative feasibility analysis into structured transition pathways. Phase 10 operationalizes system evidence into real-world policy architecture, with tools for governments, coalitions, and multilateral actors.

Structure:
- M1: Global leverage map by region and governance system
- M2: Stakeholder-specific transition roles and co-responsibility logic
- M3: Prioritized interventions by resistance profile, time horizon, and impact
- M4: Global feasibility briefing for UN, development banks, and agencies
- M5: National playbook for staged implementation based on capacity, risk, and governance

Conclusion:
Plant-based reform is no longer a theoretical model. This framework delivers actionable, adaptive tools that allow real actors to phase in transitions under known constraints. The system is policy-ready.
